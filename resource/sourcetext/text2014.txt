<gb> &quot; at the time , <ge> the Town Hall traffic lights were installed because this was a school route <gb> , &quot; explained Eckert yesterday <ge> .
we have the museum , two churches , the spa gardens , the bus stop , a doctor &apos;s practice and a bank <gb> , not to mention the traffic from the &apos; Grub &apos; residential area <ge> .
<gb> &quot; at times of high road and pedestrian traffic , <ge> an additional set of lights were required to ensure safety <gb> , &quot; said Eckert <ge> .
<gb> &quot; according to current measurements , <ge> around 12,000 vehicles travel through the town of Gutach on the <gb> B33 on a daily basis , of which heavy goods traffic accounts for around ten per cent , &quot; emphasised Arnold . <ge>
a total of four road safety inspections were carried out <gb> and a roundabout was also considered , however , this idea was rejected on account of the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstrasse junctions <ge> .
the traffic light system itself <gb> , which cost around EUR 15,000 , <ge> is the <gb> &quot; <ge> most modern system that is currently available on the market <gb> , &quot; explained Arnold <ge> .
<gb> and <ge> they are <gb> also <ge> energy-efficient : the older light systems consume around 100 Watts , with the new ones consuming just eight .
<gb> if the pedestrian presses the button at the traffic lights , <ge> the top radar sensor checks the traffic status .
<gb> &quot; <ge> if a group of people or if disabled persons are crossing the street , the green phase is extended <gb> , thus ensuring that everyone gets safely across the street , &quot; explained Arnold <ge> .
<gb> yesterday this was not the case : the <ge> light had barely turned green for pedestrians when a luxury vehicle sped through on a red light .
<gb> on the predominantly empty stage - with one important requirement : a crumpled sofa , on which cast members allude to copulating and masturbating - <ge> the eight-person ensemble work their way through the text material .
the <gb> 70-minute <ge> performance glosses over the script with a host of director &apos;s additions <gb> , well-known from the repertoire of post-dramatic theatrical styles <ge> .
only towards the end does the highly charged performance start to wind down <gb> , and we see flashes of Winkler &apos;s somewhat absurd sense of humour <ge> .
<gb> as <ge> America &apos;s road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system <gb> , many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car <ge> .
they are exploring how <gb> , over the next decade , <ge> they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over .
thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes <gb> , some of which have GPS monitoring , for a test drive <ge> .
<gb> the push comes as <ge> the country &apos;s Highway Trust Fund <gb> , financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump , <ge> is broke .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the gas tax is just not sustainable <gb> , &quot; said Lee Munnich , a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota <ge> .
it is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals <gb> , as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases , for example <ge> .
<gb> but Rep. Bill Shuster ( R-Pa . ) , chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has said <ge> he , too , sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .
&quot; this is not just a tax going into a black hole , <gb> &quot; said Adrian Moore , vice president of policy at Reason <ge> .
the movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries <gb> , who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction <ge> .
the U.S. Senate approved a $ 90-million <gb> pilot <ge> project <gb> last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars <ge> .
<gb> but <ge> the House leadership killed the proposal <gb> , acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town <ge> .
and the <gb> I-95 Coalition , which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is studying how they could go about implementing the change . <ge>
<gb> in Nevada , where about <ge> 50 volunteers &apos; cars were equipped with the devices <gb> not long ago , drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> concerns about Big Brother <gb> and those sorts of things <ge> were a major problem <gb> , &quot; said Alauddin Khan , who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation <ge> .
there is no need to build an enormous , unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals <gb> &apos; everyday comings and goings <ge> .
it was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance <gb> , in which drivers would pay based on their mileage <ge> .
but the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners <gb> because they don &apos;t use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information , uploaded periodically by modem <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> people will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location <gb> , &quot; said Ryan Morrison , chief executive of True Mileage <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> motorists would be attracted to participate <gb> because of the value of the benefits it offers to them , &quot; says a city planning document <ge> .
<gb> some transportation planners , though , wonder if <ge> all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction .
<gb> at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area , <ge> officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes .
&quot; there is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin , <gb> &quot; said Randy Rentschler , the commission &apos;s director of legislation and public affairs <ge> .
<gb> if we do this , <ge> hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy <gb> and a host of other things <ge> .
two fire fighters equipped with respiratory gear prepared to enter the building <gb> following the initial inspection of the situation by Hans Kammerer <ge> .
<gb> for Hans Kammerer , <ge> the exercise was <gb> also <ge> a chance to show what can be achieved <gb> with just a few available staff <ge> .
&quot; education is an important factor for the location , &quot; highlighted Claudia Stehle , Director of the Hans Thoma School <gb> , which introduced the networked Hochschwarzwald Education Centre Schools Project <ge> .
since 2011 , there has been successful collaboration in Wälderstadt between the Support Centre <gb> , the District Grammar School and the Vocational School Complex <ge> .
<gb> he also stated that an <ge> increasing number of employed persons are looking after the long-term care <gb> and support of relatives <ge> .
<gb> &quot; without support from their employer , <ge> the resulting burden placed on employees could result in the termination of the employment contract <gb> , &quot; said Wolf <ge> .
<gb> for it is only if a sufficient number of educational places can be provided that <ge> the need for skilled workers can be covered .
<gb> in addition to this , on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg , <ge> he experienced <gb> first-hand <ge> the efforts <gb> already <ge> undertaken to develop public transport .
&quot; you must continue to be tenacious and make sure that local public transport becomes even better <gb> , <ge> &quot; <gb> he explained in the address given to the local politicians in attendance <ge> .
it was 15 years ago that the Kaul family first invited the Dietingen senior citizens for coffee and cake <gb> , followed by a snack <ge> .
<gb> according to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlingen Municipal Planning and Building Control Authority , <ge> the ongoing procedure plans to involve the Regional Memorial Authority in the planning stage and to draw up a renovation concept for the old wall .
a cost calculation is to be performed by a team of professionals <gb> , which will then be submitted to the Town Council , which will make a decision and determine the ongoing procedure <ge> .
deep cracks in a number of individual stones testify to the weather damage <gb> , however , at present the wall is not in danger of collapse <ge> .
the school yard renovation was originally planned back in 2008 / 2009 <gb> , however , high unplanned expenses meant that the work had to be pushed back <ge> .
the Regional Memorial Authority will have a major say in the historic school wall renovation <gb> , which has even been used for filming <ge> .
<gb> if this authority were to impose requirements , then the <ge> town of Bräunlingen would hope to receive subsidies from the monument preservationists .
the pupils of the Bräunlingen Primary School <gb> , who are now being taught in a well renovated old school building , with a new hall , <ge> will soon be able to use the old school yard as well .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I do not think it is right to abandon <gb> comprehensive <ge> training <gb> in the Stuttgart Music College , &quot; said Özdemir , speaking to the &quot; Stuttgarter Nachrichten <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> as such , <ge> Özdemir <gb> , who <ge> is <gb> the favourite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the parliamentary elections on 22 September , is <ge> in disagreement with the Green-Red State Government .
<gb> on the basis of an expert study , <ge> this government is urging the reorganisation of the five music colleges in Baden-Wuerttemberg .
<gb> in accordance with these plans , <ge> the jazz and pop courses <gb> , among others , <ge> are to be relocated from the Stuttgart Music College to the Mannheim Music College .
three suspects were detained in relation to the discovery <gb> , with eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized <ge> .
<gb> due to the elaborate configuration of the tunnel , <ge> investigators are working on the assumption that it was build by architects and engineers <gb> and that the construction took around one year <ge> .
since 2006 , eight tunnels of this type have been discovered <gb> , the press conference in San Diego continued <ge> .
town Musical Director <gb> , Rudolf Barth , <ge> has composed a commissioned piece <gb> for the town <ge> on the occasion of the anniversary <gb> , which will be performed on three dates <ge> .
the new chronicle is to be presented on 21 or 22 November <gb> in the new Festival Hall in Geisingen <ge> .
the town of Geisingen was first officially documented in the year 764 <gb> , in a deed of donation , which is now in the possession of the St. Gallen Monastery <ge> .
the deed was drawn up in Kirchen <gb> ( Hausen ) , which at the time was the location of the courthouse <ge> .
one reason for choosing 2014 to celebrate <gb> the 1,250-year anniversary in this way , <ge> is that it also coincides with the 40th anniversary of the Community Reform <gb> ( Gemeindereform ) <ge> .
should the <gb> &quot; Am Hirschen &quot; <ge> railway crossing be reconstructed at great cost <gb> , in order to increase traffic safety <ge> ?
<gb> in particular , <ge> safety at railway crossings is to be increased - collisions between trains and other vehicles <gb> frequently <ge> occur at these across the country .
larger vehicles <gb> , for example those that transport long logs , <ge> would be able to wait there in the event of oncoming traffic <gb> , without having to block the railway line <ge> .
<gb> Mayor Thomas Haas retorted : <ge> the &quot; Hirschen &quot; railway crossing is used <gb> regularly <ge> for the transportation of long logs .
<gb> furthermore , when the Hauptstrasse is blocked , <ge> the route would <gb> also <ge> serve as a bypass for <gb> those <ge> vehicles <gb> that are not permitted to use the tunnel , argued Haas <ge> .
the councillors agreed to have an investigation <gb> conducted as to what costs the planned widening of the road would incur <ge> .
<gb> because both the transportation of wood and turning are both possible as things are , <ge> the reconstruction of the railway crossing should not be consented to <gb> , argued Haas <ge> .
the trains themselves <gb> , coming from the central station , <ge> must also be sufficiently slowed down <gb> so that there is no threat of collision <ge> .
for their &quot; Cosmic Vision &quot; programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects <gb> , which should greatly advance research <ge> .
<gb> at the beginning of September , <ge> the elite in the field <gb> of European space research <ge> met <gb> in Paris <ge> to discuss proposals for such missions .
<gb> in total , <ge> four main questions were chosen by the ESA <gb> , to which the missions of the &quot; Cosmic Vision &quot; programme , initiated in 2007 , are to find the answers <ge> .
the precise processes for the formation of stars from large gas clouds <gb> - and thus the formation of the planets that orbit these stars - <ge> lie in proverbial darkness .
<gb> in order to pursue this question , <ge> the &quot; Cheops &quot; space telescope is to be launched in 2017 <gb> , with which 500 known planetary systems in proximity to us will be investigated in greater detail <ge> .
<gb> with larger instruments , <ge> astronomers could map planets similar to Earth and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres <gb> , and thus search for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases that serve as an indicator for biological activity <ge> .
the magnetic activity of a star <gb> , the interaction of its magnetic field and the emitted particle radiation <ge> play an important role .
it is possible to investigate these processes in our solar system <gb> , to serve as an example to be applied elsewhere <ge> .
with the &quot; Solar Orbiter , &quot; the ESA has already approved an M-class mission <gb> ( for which the budget stands at around half a million Euro ) <ge> to address this matter .
<gb> they want to find our <ge> what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system .
the &quot; Juice &quot; <gb> ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) <ge> probe is planned to begin its journey in 2022 .
outer space offers many possibilities for studying substances under extreme conditions <gb> and thus examining whether the laws of nature , as known to us , are still valid there <ge> .
<gb> there may also be <ge> deviations <gb> that <ge> could show physicians <gb> the path to <ge> a new theory <gb> , under the umbrella of which all known natural laws could be united <ge> .
thus far , researchers know neither which physical laws <gb> applied in the initial moments after the Big Bang <ge> , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .
<gb> with a special telescope , <ge> the probe is to examine the distribution of material in the universe <gb> across the entire sky , thus enabling conclusions to be drawn regarding the properties of dark matter and dark energy <ge> .
<gb> many <ge> physicians perceive <gb> this to entail <ge> changes in the structure of space-time <gb> , which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago <ge> .
<gb> unlike systems on Earth , <ge> it could also prove gravitational waves created during the Big Bang <gb> , and thus provide fresh knowledge regarding the origin of the cosmos <ge> .
<gb> among others , <ge> proposals that have already been ruled out include proposals for bringing samples back from Mars , conducting research on the moon <gb> , Venus and asteroids , as well as proposals in the area of solar physics <ge> .
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met Mr Snowden in Russia <gb> , where he has been granted asylum , to discuss him testifying in Germany <ge> .
<gb> in the letter , <ge> Mr Snowden said he believed the support of the international community <gb> could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him <ge> .
<gb> relations between the US and <ge> Germany <gb> have come under strain following <ge> claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela &apos;s Merkel &apos;s phone .
<gb> Mr Ströbele said that , <ge> according to the former NSA contractor &apos;s lawyer , Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left .
if Mr Snowden testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be &quot; safe &quot; there <gb> , the MP said <ge> .
the letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities <gb> &quot; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> the new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin , so <ge> small bags under the seat will still be free .
<gb> frontier said <ge> it will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance <gb> , $ 100 if travelers wait to pay until they &apos;re at the gate <ge> .
<gb> it &apos;s about Frontier &apos;s most loyal customers making it very clear that <ge> finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult .
<gb> that means <ge> one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free <gb> , while the next person in line might owe $ 100 for a similar bag <ge> .
o &apos;Malley said Frontier &apos;s website and check-in procedures are being changed <gb> to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate <ge> .
they argue that luggage costs money to handle <gb> , and passengers who want the service should pay for it <ge> .
spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry-on fee <gb> three years ago , and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed <ge> .
the only other airline with such a fee is Hungary &apos;s Wizz Air <gb> , said airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely tracks add-on fees <ge> .
Sorensen <gb> , a former executive with Midwest Airlines , <ge> flew Spirit recently and wondered what he &apos;d find at the gate <gb> as passengers encountered Spirit &apos;s unusual carry-on bag fee <ge> .
frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can <gb> , and it will give coffee refills for free <ge> .
us Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down <gb> seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed <ge> .
frontier &apos;s move <gb> to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don &apos;t buy direct from the airline <ge> is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website .
that has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly from them <gb> instead of going through an online travel agency <ge> .
<gb> in September <ge> it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency .
revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter <gb> , according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc <ge> .
at least 40 women attended the last women &apos;s breakfast of the year <gb> , in the Evangelical Parish of Bisingen <ge> .
the theme of the day in the parish hall was &quot; Sayings from the Bible &quot; <gb> and &quot; Expressions from the Middle Ages . &quot; <ge>
Zita Köhler <gb> , the Chairperson of the Parish Council , <ge> agreed to give a talk on Biblical proverbs after breakfast .
she explained the meaning and origin of the expressions <gb> , which she referred to as &quot; bridges to the past <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the prizes were placed <gb> , covered , <ge> on a table and were humorously paraphrased prior to being presented to the winners .
<gb> under the management of the Federal Employment Agency , <ge> 49 men and women <gb> who are already working within the industry as untrained workers , <ge> will be trained as qualified hotel and restaurant staff over the course of three winters .
<gb> &quot; <ge> what &apos;s innovative about it is that the six-month courses end with diplomas <gb> , &quot; said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Employment Agency <ge> .
<gb> there are many benefits : the participants will not be unemployed , the companies receive trained skilled workers , which are in continually increasing demand in hotels and restaurants , and <ge> the agency will not have to fund unemployment .
also involved in the project are the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association <gb> ( Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststätte , DEHOGA ) of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error <gb> that occurred during a scheduled update , &quot; the spy agency said in an emailed statement <ge> .
<gb> earlier this evening <ge> online server trackers noted the NSA &apos;s website had been down for <gb> at least <ge> six hours , and the site continues to be inaccessible <gb> for some users <ge> .
<gb> earlier an <ge> NSA spokesperson told ABC News the agency &apos;s internal , sensitive network was &quot; not at all &quot; compromised .
<gb> at least <ge> one hacktivist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the NSA site <gb> with a DDoS attack <ge> .
DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic <gb> until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses <ge> .
the cyber tactic is a relatively unsophisticated one <gb> and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system <ge> .
<gb> stating a reason for this , Felder-Bauer said : &quot; <ge> we have barely any skilled workers in the fields of skilled crafts and trades , healthcare and geriatric care . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; while the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated , <ge> we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation <gb> , &quot; Doerksen said in a client note <ge> .
<gb> however , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we suspect that <ge> the market will become more skeptical of the program .
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end <gb> of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus <ge> .
<gb> but firm orders for the CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as <ge> potential buyers wait for flight test results <gb> to validate the company &apos;s claims about the new jetliner &apos;s fuel efficiency and cost savings potential <ge> .
chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier <gb> would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use <ge> .
the second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks <gb> , with the remainder following shortly after , the company said <ge> .
still , analysts are skeptical <gb> the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight <ge> .
Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-into-service <gb> ( EIS ) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months <ge> .
&quot; this slow pace of flight testing <gb> - although in line with Bombardier &apos;s internal schedule apparently - <ge> reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1 / 15 , &quot; said Doerksen .
<gb> for the third quarter ended September 30 , <ge> Bombardier &apos;s net profit fell to $ 147 million <gb> , or 8 cents per share , <ge> from $ 172 million <gb> , or 9 cents per share a year earlier <ge> .
the world &apos;s fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter <gb> , down from 57 a year earlier <ge> .
the backlog in the aerospace division was $ 32.9 billion <gb> as of September 30 , unchanged from December 31 <ge> .
Bombardier , the world &apos;s largest trainmaker , said revenue in that division rose <gb> nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion <ge> .
the order backlog in the transportation unit was $ 32.6 billion <gb> as of September 30 , up marginally from December 31 <ge> .
shares of Bombardier <gb> , which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board , <ge> were down 8.5 percent at C $ 4.83 <gb> in mid afternoon trading <ge> on Thursday .
Brazil &apos;s Embraer SA <gb> , the world &apos;s third-largest commercial planemaker and Bombardier &apos;s closest rival , <ge> reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday .
<gb> while the airport management announced via short messaging service Twitter that the shooter is in custody , <ge> the &quot; Los Angeles Times &quot; reported that the man is dead .
<gb> the incident took place in Terminal 3 . <ge> eye witnesses reported seeing a shooter with a gun in one of the departure lounges <gb> , as was reported by several media <ge> .
an employee <gb> of the &quot; Los Angeles Times &quot; who was travelling at the time <ge> told of how he had heard two shots fired .
<gb> according to a message shared by the airport management via twitter , <ge> the incident began at 9.30 am ( local time ) .
Basharat Ditta <gb> , 42 , <ge> would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough <gb> about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit <ge> .
<gb> inquiries revealed <ge> Ditta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair <gb> , on his wallet and on his credit cards <ge> .
they <gb> and 32 other men <ge> were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine <gb> worth £ 1.5million along with more than £ 200,000 in cash during a series of raids <ge> .
the lawyer &apos;s downfall came after police <gb> investigating Scarborough <ge> discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta <gb> in February 2011 <ge> .
two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta &apos;s house in and was seen to place the drugs <gb> which had a purity of 60 per cent <ge> under the lawyer &apos;s bins <gb> in a black golf glove <ge> .
<gb> soon after the drop off , <ge> Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta <gb> who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium , Ewood Park <ge> .
the court heard Ditta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of cocaine <gb> after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair , wallet and on his credit cards <ge>
ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine <gb> and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to &quot; legal privilege <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
during his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet <gb> and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him <ge> .
<gb> in a police interview he said <ge> he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business .
but the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain <gb> , some of whom he had previously represented , <ge> after key arrests <gb> to tell them what detectives knew about them <ge> .
<gb> prosecuting , Anne Whyte said : &quot; <ge> if anyone should know not to the break the law , it is a criminal solicitor . <gb> &quot; <ge>
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor <gb> , having become too involved with specific clients <ge> .
the relationship we are talking about is <gb> not simply a drug dealer , but <ge> a drug dealer providing his <gb> own <ge> lawyer with drugs .
he thwarted the police &apos;s investigation as much as possible <gb> to enable them to continue in their criminal activities <ge> .
he got too close to certain clients , <gb> in particular Scarborough , <ge> and <gb> he <ge> allowed his independence to be compromised .
<gb> but after the hearing supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said : &quot; <ge> Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself <gb> the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
his addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups <gb> who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations <ge> .
let this case serve as a warning to criminals <gb> that no one is beyond the reach of the law <ge> .
thirty five other men involved in the racket were jailed <gb> for a total of 153 years for drugs offences <ge> .
<gb> patron Johan Philipp Neumann has in mind for <ge> the mass to be performed as part of the church services .
<gb> the 2015 <ge> Parish Council <gb> elections <ge> will bring about fundamental change <gb> , for example in the Haslach Pastoral Care Unit ( Seelsorgeeinheit Haslach , SE ) <ge> .
in a joint meeting on Saturday , the committees <gb> from Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschensteinach <ge> prepared for the changes .
this is because there are no further changes to be made to the fundamental decisions of the diocese <gb> and it is up to the Parish Councils to implement these in as satisfactory a manner possible <ge> .
<gb> regional Dean <ge> Georg Schmitt explained the newly drawn-up guidelines for pastoral care units <gb> in the arch-diocese of Freiburg with the help of a presentation <ge> .
<gb> according to the guidelines , <ge> the SE Haslach <gb> , as a church community , <ge> will be a corporation under public law , which shall assume the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities .
there will then only be one joint Parish Council <gb> and a Foundation Council , in which the rector will be represented by virtue of his office <ge> .
<gb> from each parish , <ge> at least two elected members are to be represented <gb> , with so-called church community teams set up on-site in the six parishes <ge> .
accounts payable <gb> , on the other hand , <ge> will be passed over to the &quot; church community &quot; as a whole .
<gb> &quot; in the past , <ge> investments were only made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes by themselves <gb> , &quot; said Haslach &apos;s Parish Council Chairman Bruno Prinzbach <ge> .
Barbar Ritter <gb> , Chair of the Committee in the Schutterwald-Neuried pastoral care unit , <ge> has practical experience of a joint committee for five parishes .
the Committees of the Haslach pastoral care unit set out to answer questions <gb> regarding the future composition and size of the joint Parish Council , and the practical work of the church community teams <ge> .
the specific details will be confirmed in subsequent meetings <gb> and decided in an additional joint meeting of all six committees in the coming spring <ge> .
<gb> at the end , Parish Counsellor <ge> Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo <gb> of the pastoral care unit , which was agreed on by a clear majority <ge> .
<gb> as Managing Director of the municipal energy company , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed to the SÜDKURIER , <ge> families of four in Pfullendorf will be on the receiving end of a price increase of EUR 70 to 90 per year .
this levy will be reset by the four operators of the large power grids <gb> , in October of each year <ge> .
they estimate the additional costs <gb> they will incur as a result of the &quot; energy turnaround , &quot; <ge> which they will be able to recover <gb> by means of a levy on the price of electricity <ge> .
<gb> in its projections , <ge> the supervisory council of the energy company even assumed a levy higher than that reported by Jörg-Arne Bias .
<gb> the specific <ge> figures must now be calculated before the municipal energy cmpany can inform its customers <gb> of the precise price increase next week <ge> .
the waiting time must <gb> , however , <ge> be &quot; appropriate , <gb> &quot; which can be interpreted differently on a case-to-case basis <ge> .
Becker advises that you wait at least five minutes <gb> before a fault with the traffic lights can be assumed <ge> .
anyone who drives on in spite of a red light <gb> must , however , be aware that he / she <ge> will be fully liable for any resulting accident .
anyone who waits for less than five minutes has <gb> , under certain circumstances , <ge> not waited long enough <gb> , warned Becker , referring to a ruling of the Hamm Higher Regional Court <ge> .
he was spared a driving ban <gb> on account of the special circumstances - but was not spared a fine <ge> .
<gb> every time discussion in Town Council meetings turns to the budget , <ge> Mayor Ralph Gerster has good reason to smile .
<gb> as Andrea Rothmund explained , <ge> the administrative budget came in at more than EUR one million higher than originally planned <gb> , at around 7.6 million Euro <ge> .
the administrative budget surplus , <gb> at around EUR 1.8 million , also <ge> stood at around EUR one million above projections .
the surplus is <gb> primarily <ge> due to higher trade tax income <gb> and the local authorities &apos; contribution towards income tax <ge> .
because fewer investments were made in the 2012 <gb> budgetary year than planned , the reserves also came in higher <ge> .
<gb> in total , <ge> they managed to increase the general contingency reserves by around EUR 2.1 million <gb> , to a total of EUR 4.9 million <ge> .
&quot; a job like this is not something you achieve overnight , <gb> &quot; said Gerster in praise of the annual financial statement <ge> .
<gb> it may sound like a paradox , but it is precisely <ge> these good figures that could soon work out expensive for the citizens .
<gb> however , according to Gerster , <ge> from time to time this has resulted in subsidies being reduced by the state .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we have to address the subject of municipal rates , as there are investments to be made in the coming years <gb> for which we could do with subsidies , &quot; commented Gerster regarding this matter <ge> .
<gb> having been a singer for 60 years , <ge> Hubert Wermter &apos;s story with the Cäcilia Male Choral Society is almost twice as long as that of the Autumn Festival <gb> , during which he was ceremonially honoured <ge> .
<gb> even after 60 years <ge> he still finds great pleasure from singing with the choir <gb> , which has achieved much more than popularity during this period <ge> .
the Vollmaringen Male Voice Choir got things running <gb> with atmospheric songs such as &quot; Im Weinparadies &quot; and &quot; Lustig , ihr Brüder <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
they had also prepared a short serenade as a tribute to their honorary singer <gb> Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart &apos;s &quot; Bundeslied <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> the <ge> Betra Male Voice Choir also sang classic choral pieces such as &quot; Jägerwerben &quot; by Julius Wengert , &quot; weit , weit weg &quot; by Hubert Goisern <gb> and the folk song &quot; Wann du durchgehst durchs Tal <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
with its mixed choir and its ladies <gb> &apos; <ge> ensemble - <gb> the &quot; <ge> Impulschor <gb> &quot; ( Impulse Choir ) <ge> , the Salzstetten Choral Club ensured that <gb> the <ge> female quota was fulfilled at <gb> the <ge> festival .
the Schwarzwälder <gb> Bote ( Black Forest Herald ) , in collaboration with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb Savings Bank , <ge> would like to support the institutions in granting their construction and renovation wishes .
<gb> if they have a construction or renovation request for their institution , <ge> they can register this with the Schwarzwälder Bote .
get creative with your children and surprise the judging panel <gb> of the Kindergarten-Baustelle ( Nursery School-Construction Site ) campaign <ge> .
<gb> a panel consisting of representatives from the Schwarzwälder Bote , Bauhaus and Sparkasse <ge> Zollernalb will select three wishes from those submitted .
it must be possible to fulfil the wish using construction materials to a maximum value of EUR 2,000 <gb> and on one ( campaign ) day <ge> .
they will be delivered to the nursery schools on an agreed day <gb> and should there be assembled / made use of directly by the helpers <ge> .
<gb> he said the new media tribunal &quot; will always be biased because it &apos;s an extension of the government , &quot; and that <ge> restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya &apos;s place in the global economy .
the passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to reinforce national security <gb> in the wake of the September &apos;s attack by Islamist gunmen on the Westgate shopping mall <ge> .
police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive <gb> for questioning , although the summons was retracted following a media outcry <ge> .
the tribunal also has the power to seize the property <gb> of an offender if a fine is not paid <ge> .
<gb> it also said <ge> the measures could have a devastating effect <gb> on what it described as Kenya &apos;s &quot; lively blogosphere <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
&quot; no one will ever know , &quot; wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu <gb> , describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life <ge> .
<gb> &quot; left to themselves , <ge> politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering <gb> , &quot; he wrote <ge> .
<gb> in May <ge> they voted to overturn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission <gb> and reinstate their hefty salaries of around 532,000 shillings a month tax-free - ranked among the highest in the world <ge> .
the official inaugural ceremony <gb> for the astro-turf sports field <ge> did not wane in significance for the town and the football club <gb> , in spite of the cold weather and rain <ge> .
everyone <gb> had <ge> hoped for <gb> more <ge> pleasant conditions for the ceremony <gb> last Saturday , however the weather gods chose not to cooperate <ge> .
this was the case for the musicians who accompanied the ceremony <gb> , as well as for a number of speakers <ge> .
<gb> thus , FC <ge> Chairman Albrecht Schlenker <gb> , who spoke of the fulfilment of a dream , also <ge> got fairly wet .
his thanks went first and foremost to Mayor Walter Klumpp <gb> , who was heavily involved in the realisation of the project , the Town Council , the companies involved and club members who played a part <ge> .
it was way back 15 years ago that solutions to the problem were first considered <gb> , when the construction of a third pitch on the football club site or at the secondary school on Salinensee Lake were considered <ge> .
<gb> six years ago , <ge> thoughts turned to laying an astro-turf pitch <gb> , which was generally viewed as the perfect solution <ge> .
specific plans were drawn up two years ago <gb> , when the FC inherited the Schabelstube in leasehold , promised a contribution of EUR 100,000 for the construction of the pitch and the state approved a subsidy of EUR 104,000 <ge> .
<gb> in October 2012 , <ge> the Town Council decided to cover the remaining EUR 356,000 <gb> of the total cost of EUR 560,000 , summarised Klumpp <ge> .
during the construction phase <gb> , which lasted over three months , <ge> 3,000 cubic metres of earth were removed <gb> , of which half was used for the laying of a dirt bike track <ge> .
the SPD would like to put an end to the pressure <gb> placed on immigrant children to decide on one nationality - the Union rejects the notion of a dual passport <ge> .
<gb> regarding the subject of traffic , which was not on the agenda for this Friday , <ge> the SPD substantiated its opposition to a car toll charge promoted by the CSU .
the introduction of a toll for cars would <gb> also <ge> only be a first step <gb> , in Pronold &apos;s eyes <ge> .
<gb> Stuttgart - <ge> &quot; When will it be summer again ? &quot; was <gb> actually <ge> not the question <gb> on people &apos;s lips at the Killesberg Open-Air Theatre on Friday evening <ge> .
<gb> according to information from the police , <ge> a 41-year-old <gb> from Müsch <ge> was travelling in <gb> his car on the Kempener bypass in <ge> the direction of Grefrath <gb> , at around 9.15 p.m .. <ge>
<gb> as <ge> he went to turn right <gb> onto St. Töniser Straße he failed to see the 37-year-old &apos;s oncoming vehicle <ge> .
<gb> as airport spokesperson Peter Kleeman announced to Radio Vienna that in adjusting the approach towards announcements , <ge> Vienna Airport is following an international trend .
<gb> among others , <ge> the airports in Kopenhagen , Frankfurt and Dubai have already done away with the noisy call-outs .
<gb> while they are of course a Scottish tradition , <ge> they have been given a touch of Swabian colour <gb> at the Kaltenhof event grounds <ge> .
teams and individual competitors will be pitted against one another <gb> in the disciplines of tossing the caber , horseshoe tossing and bucket carrying <ge> .
Heinz Koch from Weilen unter den Rinnen will also be there <gb> , better known as the &apos; singing inn keeper and black sausage baron <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the celebrations will get under way on Friday <gb> , with the &quot; Stoppelacker &quot; ( Stubble Field ) party featuring DJ Ralf <ge> .
<gb> the <ge> event is organised by the community hall association <gb> , the ski club and the &quot; Zündkapsele &quot; ( blasting caps ) tractor enthusiasts <ge> .
50 grams of apple sauce <gb> or a tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water <ge> are also suitable .
a dough becomes fluffy <gb> by replacing egg with a mixture of one tablespoon of baking powder , one tablespoon of cornflour and three tablespoons of mineral water , for example <ge> .
<gb> according to information from the Vegetarian Association , <ge> around 800,000 Germans currently have a vegan diet <gb> , i.e. a 100 % vegetable diet <ge> .
<gb> on the way to their host families in Weymouth , Massachusetts , <ge> the pupils of the Schwarzwald Grammar School got to know the American city of New York .
<gb> after an eight-hour flight , <ge> they headed straight for Brooklyn Bridge <gb> , via which the heart of the city , Manhattan , can be reached on foot <ge> .
from here there is a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline <gb> , which is particularly impressive in the evening light <ge> .
<gb> in spite of a shutdown , <ge> they were able to visit the Statue of Liberty on the second day <gb> , and climb the statue on foot <ge> .
on the third day , the pupils were able to take in an overview of the fascinating city from the viewing platform of the Empire State Building <gb> , enjoying the views from a height of 373 metres <ge> .
they then made their way through the hustle and bustle of the New York streets <gb> , via the Rockerfeller Center , to Central Park , which provided the perfect opportunity to rest a while in the Autumn sun <ge> .
following a short flight from New York to Boston , the pupils have now arrived with their host families <gb> and are experiencing the school day at Weymouth High School <ge> .
<gb> once again this year , on Saint Hubert &apos;s day , <ge> a Hubert mass will be celebrated in the Parish of St. Marien <gb> on Hülsbergstrasse <ge> .
St. Hubert was <gb> , according to legend , a truly ruthless hunter , who converted following a vision and was <ge> later appointed Bishop of Lüttich .
hunting horn group &quot; Jagdreiter Westfalen , &quot; under the directorship of Brigitte Kluth , played old , traditional French melodies <gb> on parforce horns ( natural horns in the key of E flat ) <ge> .
the wind players <gb> wear riding clothes , as they <ge> provide musical accompaniment mainly for riders , horses and packs of hounds on drag hunts .
<gb> according to dictionaries , <ge> déjà vu is defined as a psychological phenomenon <gb> , which expresses itself in the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation <ge> .
a glance into the internal workings <gb> at Opschlag 8 <ge> gives the onlooker a positive feeling <gb> right from the outset <ge> .
<gb> with its ultra-modern yet cosy café ambience , <ge> it looks like a place designed to make you feel good .
the team here , with business founders <gb> , Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner <ge> at the helm , spoils guests with a wide range of coffees and cocktails .
the owners <gb> , both 33 years old , <ge> have already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs <gb> prior to opening the chic café on the Opschlag : they previously managed the &quot; Art Lounge &quot; in Kranenburg <ge> .
<gb> in actual fact , here <ge> the pair hope to appeal as much to young students as they do to senior citizens and all age brackets .
<gb> perhaps this is why Daniel Büttner is not a vocal fan of evening events : &quot; <ge> you just cannot please everyone . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> and with an event , <ge> I am always only appealing to those who have expressed an interest in the special event .
this is with regard to the quality of the products that are offered here <gb> , as well as the team and the fantastic setting on the Opschlag in Kleve <ge> .
this is to the delight of many Kleve residents <gb> , guests from near and far and the students who are discovering the &apos; restaurant mile &apos; , and with it the Café Déjà Vu , for themselves <ge> .
this year the &quot; Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker &quot; MGV issued an invitation to its 165th anniversary celebration <gb> , which 52 guests , active singers and their wives were happy to accept <ge> .
<gb> in the clubhouse at the &quot; Witteborg &quot; Inn in Dinker , <ge> all those present enjoyed the friendly get-together in the name of music .
the Board of Directors gave special thanks to the team managed by innkeeper <gb> , Ange Pier-Ribbert , which once again delighted those present with a top class menu , and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decorations <ge> .
the United Nations is to start work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the millennium development goals <gb> , which were put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty <ge> .
Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing <gb> for &quot; sustainable development goals &quot; <ge> to replace the MDGs <gb> , which expire in 2015 , ahead of the UN sustainable development summit that began in Rio de Janeiro overnight <ge> .
they were included in the final draft of the document <gb> , which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms Gillard during the summit <ge> .
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit overnight <gb> that now is the time to &quot; rise above national interests <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; I am pleased that <ge> member states have agreed to launch <gb> and take ownership of <ge> a process to establish universal sustainable development goals <gb> - SDGs , &quot; he said <ge> .
<gb> even though the SG Achim / Baden has gone four match days without victory , <ge> a positive mood is still prevailing within the top flight handball team .
<gb> in any case , <ge> if they are to finally get back on the winning track <gb> , Malmon &apos;s team will have to improve on recent performances <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we want peace back <gb> ; we want stability , &quot; said Vanessa de Sousa , chief executive of an investment company <ge> .
fearful about the future of her country , she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with &quot; we demand security <gb> &quot; in Portuguese as she joined the crowds in the capital &apos;s Independence Square on Thursday <ge> .
<gb> for two weeks , <ge> there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and RENAMO <gb> , some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago <ge> .
RENAMO was once a notorious rebel movement <gb> , initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa &apos;s apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country &apos;s independent government <ge> .
analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back <gb> into full-blown conflict , but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals <ge> .
the ruling Frelimo party <gb> , the dominant political force since 1975 , <ge> and RENAMO blame each other for the tension .
<gb> RENAMO says <ge> the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province <gb> , traditionally a RENAMO stronghold , on October 17 <ge> .
RENAMO <gb> , which has been pushing for electoral reforms , had <ge> already said that it would boycott municipal elections <gb> due in November <ge> .
some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions <gb> and financial spoils from the government <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> he does not want multi-party democracy <gb> , he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency , &quot; Mr Mazanga said <ge> .
<gb> in June , <ge> Rio suspended its use of the railway <gb> for about a week after RENAMO threatened to attack the line <ge> .
RENAMO wanted to <gb> &quot; <ge> warn the international community that things were not going well <gb> in Mozambique , &quot; Mr Mazanga said <ge> .
&quot; no one cares about RENAMO and Frelimo , they just want peace again , they want free access to the roads <gb> , &quot; he said <ge> .
children should be taught myths and legends as &quot; models for a way of life , <gb> &quot; author says . <ge>
<gb> tales of Thor could show &quot; brute strength is no match for subtle trickery , &quot; while the <ge> Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I find it wonderful that in America , myth and folklore already has a part in education <gb> , &quot; he said <ge> .
<gb> he added <ge> authors and teachers being &quot; overtly didactic &quot; is a &quot; total switch-off &quot; for children <gb> , with messages being &quot; subliminated &quot; in enjoyable stories <ge> .
<gb> perhaps the <ge> big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necessity for some sense of hope .
<gb> 100 years ago , <ge> Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach <gb> , on Sunday his final years in the &quot; FREIHOF &quot; were brought to life <ge> .
Marcus Zagermann <gb> , serving as narrator , <ge> guided the audience <gb> through the ten different scenes , explained circumstances and provided links explaining leaps from his youth to the time when he was approaching retirement <ge> .
<gb> true to style , <ge> he travelled with a two-horse carriage drawn by &quot; Schwarzwälder Füchsen <gb> &quot; ( Black Forest Chestnut Horses ) owned by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach <ge> .
not only was he received with great applause <gb> from the audience , <ge> but was also welcomed by his sister <gb> Philippine <ge> .
Billy Sum-Hermann managed unbelievably well to place herself in the role of the sister <gb> and brought the character to life amazingly well , in terms of both her expressions and gestures <ge> .
with their song , <gb> &quot; O Jesulein , &quot; <ge> they delighted the audience in the FREIHOF <gb> , as did the &quot; Storchentagskinder &quot; with their loud cries of &quot; heraus , heraus &quot; <ge> .
<gb> in his day , <ge> Hansjakob expressed his criticism of the institutional church <gb> , as well as his concerns regarding the excesses in the rural economy , the consequences of industrialisation and the effects of the war <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we will not participate in the wild card process <gb> , &quot; said former national team player Pascal Roller , who has been putting together the concept for a professional club in the Hansa town since 2012 <ge> .
&quot; we are not concerning ourselves with the wild card process until it is certain that Düsseldorf is not receiving a licence <gb> , &quot; said boss of the Neckar Riesen Alexander Reil , speaking to our paper <ge> .
<gb> following a visit to the Nuclear Bunker Museum , <ge> the focus will turn to Haigerloch in the period after 1850 <gb> , when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule <ge> .
<gb> last but not least , <ge> while in the church eyes will also turn to the last supper painting , painted by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter .
the meeting point for the one and a half hour tour is the Nuclear Bunder Museum <gb> , at 3 : 00 p.m. <ge>
the former US intelligence expert <gb> , Edward Snowden , <ge> may make further statements regarding the US espionage scandal <gb> from his Russian asylum <ge> .
representatives of the <gb> Federal <ge> Prosecutor could <gb> either <ge> submit questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person <gb> in Russia <ge> .
this was reported by the Interfax Agency <gb> with reference to groups aware of the situation , which were not named in greater detail <ge> .
<gb> because Germany is an ally of the USA , <ge> Snowden would be at risk of deportation <gb> if he were to travel there , the source continued <ge> .
the tennis division of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf <gb> ( Rohrdorf Sports Fans ) <ge> enjoyed perfect weather <gb> for the tournament for local clubs and enthusiasts <ge> .
the matches were doubles matches <gb> with a long set up to nine points , <ge> or a maximum duration of 45 minutes .
the organisation <gb> of the tournament <ge> was placed in the trusty hands of Anja Schlichter <gb> , who was supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer <ge> .
<gb> after the first three matches and a lunch break with pasta , <ge> the tournament moved into the crucial phase .
the favourites , Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner , were tied with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic <gb> ( both teams from the SG Rohrweiler ) <ge> , meaning that the last two games had to produce a victor .
<gb> at the awards ceremony , <ge> Carmen Müller finally had the pleasure of presenting the Challenge Cup to Andre Maier <gb> and Matthias Bronner , who had shown the greatest staying power on the final leg <ge> .
<gb> on the last weekend in August , <ge> the <gb> Vogtsbauernhof Black Forest <ge> Open Air Museum <gb> in Gutach near Hornberg <ge> will once again be firmly in the hands of children .
<gb> whether producing soap , turning candles , felting or making silk , <ge> there is a suitable activity <gb> whatever your age <ge> .
the young guests will be able to demonstrate their manual skills <gb> building cuckoo pipes , water wheels or spinning tops <ge> .
the host of old games <gb> , such as wheelbarrow racing or walking on stilts , <ge> promises plenty of fun .
<gb> for any miniature detectives , <ge> the open air museum will be offering a mystery tour <gb> through the museum on Saturday and Sunday , at midday and 2.00 p.m. respectively <ge> .
<gb> in addition , <ge> visitors will have the special opportunity to get to know the open air museum <gb> on a carriage journey drawn by Black Forest Chestnut horses <ge> .
<gb> the <ge> story-teller will be taking the younger guests to the wonderful world of fairytale <gb> at 11.00 a.m. , 1 : 00 p.m. and 3 : 00 p.m. <ge>
<gb> so , <ge> visitors to the open air museum can expect a varied holiday programme <gb> right through to the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Wuerttemberg <ge> .
in a small town in New Zealand , Burt Munro is considered a lovable oddball <gb> , all because he resolved to compete in a race in America with his 1920 motorbike <ge> .
<gb> besides coal imports , <ge> Rhenus Midgard is also active in the field of wind park logistics <gb> , among other ventures <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the signals are for the purpose of security <gb> and are legally prescribed , &quot; said Matthias Schrell , Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven <ge> .
unfortunately , in the event of unfavourable wind , they can be heard from far away <gb> - and as a result there have already been a number of complaints from people from the north of the town <ge> .
the <gb> 40-year-old said that he <ge> is taking the complaints very seriously and has therefore been in touch with those affected .
<gb> with the construction of the Lower Saxony Bridge , <ge> Rhenus Midgard is continuing to focus on coal exports for power stations <gb> and is one of the major powers in this sector in Europe <ge> .
<gb> thanks to the mooring basin to the front of the terminal , sunken to a depth of 18.5 metres , <ge> it has for some time now been possible to unload capesize bulk carriers here .
<gb> when the GDF-Suez plant is added to the network , around <ge> 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year will be realistic .
<gb> the three ship unloaders on the bridge and <ge> the second transport belt could see this rise to 10 million .
<gb> initially <ge> the guests managed to turn a <gb> 15-point deficit into a lead , with 13 minutes to go , before Piräus was able to turn the game around once again . <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> we fought back incredibly well against the two-time Euroleague champions <gb> , but then once again made careless mistakes <ge> .
created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch <gb> , the founder of the standup institution Carolines , the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year , with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> most of these headliners appeared at Carolines <gb> , and went on to greater success , to the point where they &apos;re too big to play a club , &quot; Hirsch said <ge> .
several of the comedians participating in this year &apos;s festival came up through nontraditional channels <gb> , such as shows on smaller networks , like Comedy Central , FX , and Spike <ge> .
Steinberg started as a standup comedian <gb> but has become an accomplished television and film director , as well as an unofficial comedy historian <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the city is definitely in the comedy DNA <gb> of all of Larry &apos;s work , &quot; Steinberg said <ge> .
it will without doubt be a long path <gb> , but the chief nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that both sides will come to a solution in the end <ge> .
on Tuesday , armed with machetes and knives , they stabbed the 11-year-old to death and threw the body into a well <gb> , reported the &quot; El País &quot; newspaper on Thursday <ge> .
the body was found <gb> the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado , 15 kilometres to the north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este <ge> .
a five year-old half-sister of the younger offender <gb> , who they took with them , <ge> was to make a statement as an alibi <gb> , stating that she was sexually assaulted by the boy <ge> .
<gb> however , when the girl described the progression of events to the police without mentioning an attack against herself , <ge> the two boys confessed to the pre-meditated murder of the 11-year-old .
the District Court of Constance has condemned a 33-year-old man <gb> from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison for exploitative human trafficking , pimping , issuing threats and grievous bodily harm <ge> .
the former German soldier <gb> who , following two tours in Afghanistan , had worked as a doorman , <ge> made a confession within the context of a plea-bargaining procedure .
he prevented the women from making contact with the outside world <gb> by confiscating their mobile phones and SIM cards <ge> .
<gb> appearing before the court , <ge> the accused <gb> initially <ge> claimed that he was suffering from severe trauma <gb> after colleagues serving alongside him in Afghanistan had lost their lives in an explosion <ge> .
<gb> as an official from the Criminal Investigation Department reported , following the first conviction achieved using telephone surveillance measures , <ge> at least four further cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified .
a <gb> further <ge> witness , <gb> whereby one of the woman had suffered blue bruises all over her body , <ge> is yet to make a statement .
this is a case of a &quot; completely broken personality <gb> , &quot; that views the violence and exploitation in this field as normal <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I <gb> have removed myself from these circles and <ge> hope to lead a completely normal life <gb> following my imprisonment , &quot; he stated <ge> .
benchmark U.S. crude for December delivery was down 14 cents <gb> at $ 96.24 a barrel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange <ge> .
that suggests China &apos;s economic recovery could continue to strengthen <gb> after growth rebounded to 7.8 percent in the third quarter from a two-decade low in the previous quarter <ge> .
Brent crude , <gb> a benchmark for international crude also used by U.S. refineries , <ge> fell 26 cents to $ 108.58 a barrel on the ICE exchange in London .
the <gb> 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city . <ge>
the judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution <gb> in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people <ge> .
the city appealed her findings and her remedial orders <gb> , including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it <ge> .
<gb> the <ge> judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people <gb> by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop-and-frisk program <ge> .
<gb> in August , <ge> New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people <gb> whose cases are dismissed after a police stop <ge> .
Stop-and-frisk has been around for decades in some form , but recorded stops increased dramatically <gb> under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330 , mostly of black and Hispanic men <ge> .
a lawsuit was filed in 2004 <gb> by four men , all minorities , and became a class action case <ge> .
supporters of changes to the NYPD &apos;s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices <gb> , will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy <ge> .
opponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime <gb> , waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade <ge> .
the judge noted she wasn &apos;t putting an end to the stop-and-frisk practice <gb> , which is constitutional , but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops <ge> .
<gb> it was with this piece of Bedouin wisdom that the first ever chairman <ge> Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination behind the &quot; Helping Hands &quot; society .
<gb> as a result , an important collaboration was developed and the gynaecologist , <ge> Hanne , has performed countless operations on several journeys to the location .
Rainer Prewo <gb> , the former Lord Mayor of Nagold , <ge> made the suggestion of equipping this vehicle with a photovoltaic system <gb> and , according to Henne , he is now planning to assume an advisory role within the organisation <ge> .
you learn a great deal working as a doctor in Africa <gb> , said Henne , for example that you should slow down to avoid burn-out <ge> .
in addition , containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa , for example <gb> in March of this year <ge> when medical devices <gb> , medicines , bandaging material , hospital beds and spectacles <ge> were sent .
he identified his personal motivation as being his work in the area of auditing <gb> as a young member of parliament <ge> .
<gb> when it became clear to him how much money is wasted , <ge> he decided to help the Africans with controlling of their budget by the people .
former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used &quot; phone hacking , surveillance and confrontation <gb> &quot; in an attempt to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-home secretary Charles Clarke <ge> .
a tape of voicemails <gb> taken from her phone on at least three occasions <ge> was seized from Mulcaire &apos;s home in August 2006 .
investigators also found entries on the private investigator &apos;s computer <gb> which had Ms Pawlby and her sister as &quot; Projects <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
during the period she was being investigated , Ms Pawlby &apos;s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her <gb> , Mr Edis said <ge> .
<gb> leaving her a voicemail on June 18 2005 , <ge> Coulson told her : &quot; I &apos;ve got a story that we &apos;re planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about . &quot;
Mr Edis said Coulson &apos;s involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men <gb> , such as former home secretary David Blunkett <ge> .
<gb> in protest against the planned tax on the rich , <ge> the French Football Association is set to actually go through with the first strike since 1972 .
<gb> in the conflict regarding the tax on the wealthy , <ge> the government and the professional football association <gb> in France <ge> have manoeuvred into a cul-de-sac <gb> following a failed mediation meeting <ge> .
President François Hollande welcomed club and association representatives to Paris <gb> &apos; Élysée Palace on Thursday , where he listened to their complaints <ge> .
the strike announced for the end of November will now go ahead <gb> , informed the head of the Union of Professional Football Clubs ( UCPF ) , Jean-Pierre Louvel <ge> .
the Ligue <gb> 1 and Ligue 2 <ge> match days <gb> scheduled between 29 November and 2 December <ge> will <gb> thus <ge> be cancelled .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we want to involve the residents in the planning at as early a stage as possible <gb> , &quot; said Mayor Jens Häußler , opening the citizen &apos;s information event regarding the flood protection concept in Gechingen <ge> .
<gb> Häußler made clear : &quot; <ge> the final decisions will be made by the members <gb> of the Town Council <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
Häußler commented that the flood that found Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009 <gb> , was a decisive event in raising the question of protective measures for the future <ge> .
a river basin study was commissioned in collaboration with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen <gb> , which now forms the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the goal is the protection of as many developed plots of land as possible <gb> , &quot; said Häußler <ge> .
there was resentment among <gb> local <ge> residents of the old town , who have <gb> repeatedly to <ge> suffer as a result of the overflowing of the canal network , <gb> even <ge> during normal thunderstorms .
<gb> early on Friday afternoon , <ge> two car drivers were seriously injured in a head-on collision on Landesstraße 44 <gb> ( a rural road ) <ge> .
the police <gb> completely <ge> blocked off the road <gb> immediately , but initially could not make much comment on the cause of the accident <ge> .
<gb> what is certain is that <ge> the 19-year-old female driver of a VW Golf was driving in the direction of Revensdorf <gb> and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came towards her in his Hyundai <ge> .
the two vehicles collided , <gb> whereby the woman was so severely stuck that <ge> it took the fire service almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreckage .
Philip K. Dick was a God seeker <gb> , a metaphysician , and to a certain extent his novels and stories also feature recurring themes <ge> .
<gb> Dick illustrates America - <ge> the kingdom of breathtaking technical progress , paired with paranoia , a fixation on security and the belief of having been chosen .
Dick had <gb> &apos; <ge> God experiences <gb> &apos; , and his later books read like a mixture of the Book of Revelation and a computer manual <ge> .
he wrote a &apos; Theology of the Computer &apos; <gb> and questioned what separates humans from the machine , the creator from the creation <ge> .
&quot; minority Report &quot; originates from the year 1956 <gb> , and exudes the scent of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal <ge> .
here the principle of the &quot; pre-crime &quot; is developed <gb> , i.e. something that is now more or less official doctrine within the White House <ge> .
<gb> in Dick &apos;s world , which is alarmingly similar to our own , <ge> mutants look into the future - and the police have access to this insight .
<gb> and : &quot; <ge> in our society we have no major crimes , but we do have a detention camp full of would-be criminals . <gb> &quot; they read time streams . <ge>
Dick &apos;s tale acts as a blueprint for the anti-terror laws <gb> and the phone tapping madness of the NSA <ge> .
the Police Chief argues that there is no more division of power <gb> , the military controls daily life - and what is left of the State <ge> .
<gb> the former US intelligence expert , <ge> Edward Snowden , may make further statements regarding the US espionage scandal <gb> involving Federal Chancellor , Angela Merkel , from his Russian asylum <ge> .
<gb> green Party parliament representative , Hans-Christian <ge> Ströbele <gb> , <ge> was <gb> yesterday <ge> the first German politician to meet with Snowden in Moscow <gb> , to discuss the scandal with him <ge> .
on a mild day in late August a German police helicopter buzzed low over the US consulate in Frankfurt <gb> , the financial capital of Germany <ge> .
<gb> German media say the <ge> BFV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas <gb> and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin <ge> .
<gb> but ever since Edward Snowden , the contractor turned whistleblower , began releasing his treasure trove of US surveillance secrets , <ge> European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word .
<gb> reports that <ge> the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras <gb> and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new highs <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> Germany must wake up <gb> , &quot; says Oliver Grün , president of BITMi , which represents small and medium sized German IT companies <ge> .
German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft <gb> , according to a survey published in July by EY , the consultancy <ge> .
<gb> in all the documentation leaked by Mr Snowden , there has , however , been <ge> no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies &apos; trade secrets to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities <gb> and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US <ge> .
&quot; that &apos;s not the way , &quot; Hasso Plattner <gb> , chairman of German business software company SAP , <ge> says .
if one wanted a strong European IT industry , <gb> then <ge> one shouldn &apos;t have let it die out <gb> 20 years ago <ge> .
<gb> still , <ge> the reach and technical sophistication <gb> of US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations <ge> have come as a shock to some companies <gb> who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China <ge> .
<gb> a big shift is occurring in cloud computing where <ge> European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is <gb> subject to that jurisdiction and therefore <ge> potentially vulnerable .
<gb> many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew : that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and <ge> these data must therefore be guarded at all costs .
&quot; this has been a topic for many years <gb> and hasn &apos;t fundamentally changed through the current discussion <ge> , &quot; says Kurt Bock , chief executive of chemical maker BASF .
<gb> the <ge> Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level <gb> as we spy on them too , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses <ge> .
corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have taken <gb> , in case this hands an advantage to an attacker <ge> .
Ulrich Hackenberg , board member at carmaker Audi , says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected <gb> before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices <ge> .
Germany &apos;s BFV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles <gb> when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> small and medium sized companies often lack the experience <gb> , personnel and financial resources <ge> to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access <gb> , &quot; the BFV warns in a report <ge> .
<gb> the US National Intelligence Estimate in February named <ge> France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence <gb> , behind China , according to The Washington Post <ge> .
<gb> a board member at a German blue-chip company concurred that when it comes to economic espionage , &quot; <ge> the French are the worst . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> for men , <ge> suits with a waistcoat and neckerchief are most popular <gb> , although some people do choose cream or brown combinations <ge> .
the parents of a Georgia teenager <gb> , whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym , <ge> believe their son was murdered <gb> , the family &apos;s attorney said Thursday <ge> .
Kendrick Johnson <gb> , of Valdosta , Ga . , <ge> was found Jan. 11 stuck in an upright mat <gb> propped behind the bleachers inside his high school gym <ge> .
Lowndes County sheriff &apos;s investigators concluded Johnson died in a freak accident <gb> , but the 17-year-old &apos;s family disputes that <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> they believe that it defies logic <gb> , the laws of physics as well as common sense , &quot; Crump said <ge> .
<gb> U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday <ge> he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson &apos;s death <gb> , noting that several key questions remain unanswered <ge> .
&quot; I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists <gb> &quot; for a formal investigation , he said <ge> .
Moore added that if he uncovers sufficient evidence <gb> to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to conduct it <ge> .
<gb> this is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out , as <ge> the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies climbs .
the guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children &apos;s food allergies <gb> , and how to handle them should an allergic reaction occur <ge> .
<gb> it also recommends <ge> schools have epinephrine stocked <gb> -- the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used -- <ge> to respond to potentially fatal anaphylaxis .
the aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents <gb> who might make hasty decisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns , and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex <ge> .
<gb> one intersex person , according to the BBC , said years later , <ge> &quot; I am neither a man nor a woman . &quot;
&quot; some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery , but most kids do not , <gb> &quot; he said <ge> .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people <gb> in the realm of employment , as well as levels of harassment , violence and bias crimes <ge> .
<gb> already , <ge> Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male , female or a &quot; third gender &quot; on their official documents .
German passports will have a third designation <gb> other than M or F -- X <ge> , for intersex <gb> , according to the Interior Ministry <ge> .
<gb> in 2011 , <ge> dozens of French lawmakers <gb> from that strongly Catholic country <ge> signed a petition for &quot; gender theory <gb> &quot; to be withdrawn from school textbooks <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> parenting is stressful enough <gb> without extra limitations <ge> , especially if you don &apos;t know the gender of your child <gb> , &quot; she told the parenting website <ge> .
historically , children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites <gb> , named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality <ge> .
<gb> and as little as a decade ago , <ge> the medical community thought of gender as a slate <gb> that could be erased and then redrawn <ge> .
&quot; back in the middle of the 20th century , it was called a &apos; psychiatric emergency , &apos; <gb> &quot; said Drescher <ge> .
&quot; money presented the case as a successful case of transition <gb> , but it was not , <ge> &quot; <gb> said <ge> Drescher .
<gb> but in the 1990s , with the advent of the Internet , <ge> survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward &quot; not happy with the outcome . &quot;
<gb> such was the case with <ge> Jim Bruce <gb> , a 36-year-old writer from Montana , who <ge> was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals .
<gb> so shortly after his birth in 1976 , <ge> Bruce &apos;s external organ and testes were surgically removed <gb> and he was raised as a girl <ge> .
Bruce was born with a DSD <gb> that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals <ge> .
<gb> but <ge> Anne Tamar-Mattis <gb> , executive director for California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice , <ge> worries that the German law &quot; invites labeling and stigma . &quot;
<gb> &quot; <ge> a lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions <gb> and give the child an &apos; undetermined , &apos; &quot; she said <ge> .
<gb> but we haven &apos;t seen how the law will play out , <ge> so all we can do is speculate .
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law <gb> because &quot; it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
now at 29 , Katie is married <gb> and at the University of Pennsylvania , a resident in child psychiatry <ge> .
it gives them the time to do some tests <gb> and figure it out and a period of time before they write &apos; male &apos; or &apos; female <ge> . <gb> &apos; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> it brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety <gb> that motivates parents because they don &apos;t feel they are doing the right thing , &quot; she said <ge> .
ultimately , the child will decide <gb> which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- <ge> and that &apos;s a wonderful thing .
the assailants fired on a group of children <gb> on Thursday evening in Genthin , presumably with an air gun <ge> .
the shots came from a small car <gb> , which drove past a group of six children and suddenly stopped <ge> .
because the home owners realised this immediately , the egg remnants could be cleaned off at once <gb> , meaning that no material damage occurred <ge> .
<gb> furthermore , in the town centre area , while a few fireworks were set off , <ge> no material damage was caused here either .
<gb> the <ge> residents <gb> of the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg <ge> reported that a car was wrapped in toilet paper <gb> and its wheel trims stolen <ge> .
her house is located in a peaceful neighbourhood in Stuttgart <gb> , with plenty of greenery , an old tree population , nice neighbours and not too much traffic <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> hopefully you <gb> aren &apos;t afraid of spiders ? &quot; asks Waltraud Ries , pointing out a large spider on the door frame . <ge>
<gb> furthermore : since undergoing a meniscus operation , <ge> the lady <gb> , in her mid-fifties , <ge> has had to experience for herself what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability .
<gb> &quot; <ge> our home is the best example of a property that simply doesn &apos;t work in old age <gb> , &quot; she begins to recount <ge> .
<gb> when she moved to the maisonette with her husband 20 years ago , <ge> it was simply just a pretty apartment in green surroundings .
<gb> however , she is aware that <ge> she is one of the few people to actually deal with the topic of &apos; living in old age <gb> &apos; <ge> .
<gb> even if you can afford to spend your retirement in Tuscany or Brittany , <ge> you should always take the fact that you may become ill into consideration .
<gb> &apos;However , <ge> this type of residential community would not be for me <gb> , &apos; she commented with a wink <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> the author does not wish to rule out the possibility that a pensioners &apos; residential community can work .
therefore the experience of the <gb> Stiftung Warentest consumer <ge> study is also that elderly people <gb> in particular <ge> would accept inconveniences and limitations <gb> just to be able to remain in their usual environment <ge> .
<gb> nowadays <ge> there are many possibilities for designing the house or apartment <gb> in such a way as to be barrier-free <ge> .
Ries recommends that all those working on the age-appropriate renovation of their house or apartment first seek out in-depth information <gb> and don &apos;t simply use the first tradesman that comes along <ge> .
you could <gb> of course <ge> install a stair lift inside the apartment <gb> , but the cobbled path up to the door of the apartment , featuring a number of steps would be a much greater hindrance <ge> .
following a recent meeting with Snowden in Moscow , <gb> German Green Party politician <ge> Hans-Christian Ströbele appealed to the USA not to continue to threaten him with prosecution .
<gb> Psaki emphasised that Ströbele &apos;s <ge> comments were the views of a parliamentarian <gb> , and not those of a German government member <ge> .
I am Edward Joseph Snowden <gb> , <ge> formerly employed <gb> through contracts or direct hire <ge> as a technical expert for the United States National Security Agency <gb> , and Defense Intelligence Agency <ge> .
<gb> as a result of reporting these concerns , <ge> I have faced a severe and sustained campaign of persecution <gb> that forced me from my family and home <ge> .
I am currently living in exile <gb> under a grant of temporary asylum in the Russian Federation in accordance with international law <ge> .
citizens around the world as well as high officials <gb> - including in the United States - <ge> have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system <gb> of pervasive surveillance to be a public service <ge> .
these spying revelations have resulted in the proposal of many new laws <gb> and policies to address formerly concealed abuses of the public trust <ge> .
the benefits to society of this growing knowledge are becoming increasingly clear <gb> at the same time that claimed risks are being shown to have been mitigated <ge> .
I look forward to speaking with you <gb> in your country when the situation is resolved , and thank you for your efforts in upholding the international laws that protect us all <ge> .
the Town Council consented to the sale in its most recent meeting <gb> , during the part of the meeting that was not open to the public <ge> .
President Barack Obama &apos;s closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President <gb> Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket , according to the New York Times <ge> .
the revelation is the most notable bombshell from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann <gb> &apos;s heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome , &quot; Double Down : game Change 2012 . &quot; <ge>
only half a dozen of the President &apos;s closest advisers <gb> -- including Daley , former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina , and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- <ge> knew the change was under consideration .
<gb> in an interview with Martin , <ge> Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton .
<gb> while Daley characterized the research as &quot; due diligence , &quot; Martin told CNN &apos;s Anderson Cooper that the <ge> re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls .
<gb> while Daley said he doesn &apos;t think the President &quot; was aware &quot; of the potential change , <ge> the former chief of staff admitted that it &apos;s &quot; possible &quot; Obama knew .
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research <gb> into dumping Biden from the ticket <ge> .
<gb> thus , when developing the underlying technical protocols , <ge> no attention was given to <gb> creating a stable foundation for the <ge> interception-proof exchange of mail .
when <gb> user <ge> &quot; Anna &quot; sends an email to &quot; Benni , &quot; are the pair &apos;s computers <gb> then directly <ge> connected ?
checks are generally carried out by the sender &apos;s provider <gb> as to whether the mail contains malware as an attachment <ge> .
<gb> in the case of systems such as Gmail , <ge> the robots also identify the information that Google requires for displaying context-based advertising .
if Anna and Benni communicate about their upcoming holiday travels via Gmail <gb> , <ge> Google can display <gb> corresponding links to <ge> holiday offers .
he first covered up the death of the 89-year-old <gb> and then pocketed the money for more than a year and a half <ge> .
the man was already under suspicion back in May <gb> : at that time the fact that medications for his care-reliant mother were no longer required drew suspicion <ge> .
<gb> it was discovered that <ge> the mother and son had lived in the same residence for more than 15 years <gb> and that he had cared for her in her final days <ge> .
the ice cream reacts with the eater &apos;s tongue <gb> - raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow <ge> .
<gb> Chris says because the <ge> ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth <gb> it means the more you lick , the brighter it becomes <ge> .
so as your mouth warms up <gb> the protein <ge> it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made <gb> because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold <ge> .
<gb> Charlie &apos;s experimental <ge> company <gb> , based in Bristol , <ge> is famed for its unusual flavours <gb> including beer , cheese , beef and gold leaf <ge> .
it is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals <gb> which make up the ice cream , but I reckon we will find a way of doing it <ge> .
<gb> after six match days , <ge> TSV Morsum are yet to score a single point in the Handball Association League .
<gb> and of all possible times , <ge> Ingo Ehler &apos;s team has a derby match against TSV Daverden tomorrow <gb> , which celebrated their first victory last week <ge> .
for this match he finally has his complete squad available , with the exception of Hendrick Blohme <gb> who is out with long-term injury <ge> .
Daverden &apos;s coach Thomas Panitz comes across as much more relaxed <gb> following his team &apos;s first victory of the season against Nordhorn <ge> .
<gb> nonetheless , <ge> Panitz is now looking to come up with the goods in Morsum <gb> and thus start a winning streak <ge> .
my sister and I were allowed to eat candy <gb> , stay up late and play dress-up for the neighborhood <ge> .
the majority of Americans <gb> - 158 million of them in fact - <ge> will be celebrating Halloween this year <gb> , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on candy , costumes and decorations , according to the National Retail Federation <ge> .
costumes are expected to account for $ 1.2 billion dollars <gb> out of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF <ge> .
<gb> as for men , I expect we will be seeing a lot of zombies , thanks to The Walking Dead and <ge> I &apos;ll bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into our Instagram feeds this year .
that &apos;s around 600 million pounds worth of Hershey bars <gb> , lollipops , Milk duds , Twizzlers and Clark Bars <ge> .
that &apos;s great news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters set to take over our neighborhoods <gb> , according to the U.S. Commerce Department <ge> .
the one thing we don &apos;t want to consume , candy corn <gb> ; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween , according to the National Confectioners Association <ge> .
they have the best names , like &quot; Terror Behind the Walls &quot; <gb> ( which , by the way is in an actual prison ) , &quot; Howl-O-Scream &quot; and &quot; The House of Shock . &quot; <ge>
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pumpkin when we were kids <gb> , and carving a Jack-O-Lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it &apos;s something we &apos;ve done since we were little <ge> .
<gb> lucky for us , <ge> the &quot; baby in a pumpkin trend &quot; started only last year <gb> thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up carving these gourds not sitting in them <ge> .
<gb> the Jack-O-Lantern slowly withering on your front porch probably came from <ge> Illinois , <gb> which <ge> grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year .
this comes at the same time as a possible shortage of ministers <gb> : the Protestant Lutheran Regional Church of Hanover calculates that , as things stand , the current number of around 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030 <ge> .
<gb> Burfien puts this down to the process of secularisation : &quot; <ge> God &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud . <gb> &quot; <ge>
I am the master of my own schedule <gb> and can therefore turn my focus to what is important to me <ge> .
this would suit the young people of today , as it is not just about your career <gb> , but about having a meaningful job as well <ge> .
<gb> according to information from the Regional Church , which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony , <ge> around 60 pastors retire every year .
<gb> in future <ge> it may be difficult to fill positions in sparsely populated outlying areas <gb> such as Harz , Emsland or Wendland <ge> .
options include upgraded brakes <gb> , a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics , logistic support , and vehicle storage between events <ge> .
drew Bowler <gb> , the managing director of Bowler Motorsport , <ge> said : &quot; rally customers coming to Bowler have changed . &quot;
they &apos;re not all experienced racers <gb> , but people looking for excitement and adventure , and an achievable path towards world-class events <ge> .
<gb> additionally , <ge> the Defender Challenge will provide a training and test day in February <gb> , as well as the option to compete in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East <ge> .
fire crews called to rescue lost puppy after she got stuck <gb> 50ft above the ground on precarious ledge in a quarry <ge>
a puppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to lift her <gb> to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50ft up on a precarious cliff ledge <ge> .
nine month-old cocker spaniel Ruby <gb> had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and <ge> survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday .
her owners Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 , were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme <gb> , West Yorkshire , to be reunited with Ruby and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service <ge> .
they had searched frantically for their missing dog <gb> and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the quarry following the minor accident <ge> .
a Technical Rescue Team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene <gb> and abseiled down to rescue Ruby and used a pet tube to transport her up the cliff <ge> .
Ruby was taken to the vets for a check-up <gb> and was found to be fine other than exhaustion and dehydration <ge> .
<gb> during an interview with an Australian radio show this week , <ge> the pop star <gb> said she <ge> sang backing vocals for Jagger &apos;s 2004 song <gb> &quot; Old Habits Die Hard <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
Perry <gb> was one of the singers to make <ge> a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones <gb> &apos; tour this year <ge> .
<gb> since Scotland isn &apos;t in the Schengen area now , <ge> continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up <gb> in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Scots <ge> .
<gb> and <ge> one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossilised <gb> : I first heard the &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; canard at least 40 years ago <ge> .
<gb> across the EU , <ge> parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU , or to scrapping the euro as a common currency , are gaining ground .
the austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank <gb> , coupled with the straitjacket imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency , <ge> has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far .
the crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments <gb> running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece <ge> .
<gb> rather , <ge> the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters <gb> - something German politicians want to keep <ge> .
<gb> without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation , <ge> southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany .
<gb> all the <ge> wage freezes <gb> in the world <ge> won &apos;t stop the European petrochemicals industry being hammered <gb> by cheap US shale gas <ge> .
after the war , the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check <gb> , and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington <ge> .
<gb> but <ge> Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe <gb> , leaving the battered French economy struggling <ge> .
the Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote <gb> - a timely warning to British Labour that they can &apos;t assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left <ge> .
she wants to use next year &apos;s EU elections <gb> to create an anti-EU , anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament <ge> .
<gb> if , as is very possible , <ge> anti-EU parties <gb> do well in these elections , such a bloc <ge> could dominate the European Parliament for the first time .
<gb> here &apos;s my point : <ge> sometime soon growing anti-EU and anti-common currency feeling in Europe <gb> will coalesce to kill the euro <ge> .
the EU won &apos;t disappear <gb> , but it will revert to something more like the loose &quot; Europe of the ( Sovereign ) Nations &quot; favoured by General de Gaulle <ge> .
Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro <gb> but France and southern Europe will revive their own currencies <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> Washington &apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold .
<gb> or <ge> we can defend our own economic interests <gb> - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off <ge> .
it would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence <gb> only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels <ge> .
should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to sprout breast buds <gb> and pubic hair at 7 or 8 <ge> ?
<gb> &quot; I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- <ge> usually , this does not signal a rapid progression into full puberty <gb> , &quot; said Kaplowitz <ge> .
there is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty <gb> , but it is considered &quot; precocious &quot; when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8 <ge> .
<gb> a more <ge> rapid progression may <gb> warrant tests by an endocrinologist to <ge> rule out serious problems <gb> such as tumors or cysts <ge> .
there are treatments to delay early menses <gb> and ward off another consequence : premature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to stunted growth and being short as an adult <ge> .
recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child &apos;s age <gb> , rate of development , growth rate and emotional maturity <ge> .
<gb> Kaplowitz is cautious with medication but acknowledges , &quot; <ge> suppressing puberty may alleviate behavioral issues and girls <gb> &apos; feelings of being different from peers <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> they worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene <gb> , &quot; said Kaplowitz <ge> .
yet , there &apos;s no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods <gb> , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media <ge> are to blame .
<gb> globally , <ge> patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty <gb> , &quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children &apos;s Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey <ge> .
girls who blossom early need reassurance that , <gb> even when it happens ahead of schedule , <ge> the process is a normal part of life .
how the back of the plane is laid out <gb> - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new &quot; mini-jumbo &quot; jet designs <ge> .
Boeing says its revamped &quot; <gb> 777X &quot; will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row . <ge>
Airbus says the competing version of its <gb> A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast . <ge>
<gb> now , <ge> Airbus is appealing <gb> directly <ge> to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow , where the <gb> 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders . <ge>
it recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers <gb> a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant , titled &quot; Would You Accept This <ge> ? <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props <gb> , &quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy <ge> .
<gb> Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting <ge> an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality <gb> by 53 per cent <ge> .
<gb> Boeing <ge> disputes Airbus &apos;s figures on seat measurements <gb> and says it <ge> is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions <gb> on how airlines balance fares and facilities <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> it really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful <gb> , &quot; said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver <ge> .
for flyers it is about more elbow room <gb> , but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings <ge> .
<gb> as Reuters first reported in July , <ge> seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets .
Boeing &apos;s performance claims depend in part on comparing the <gb> 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design . <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> the reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive <gb> with our products , &quot; said Kevin Keniston , head of passenger comfort at Europe &apos;s Airbus <ge> .
<gb> on the other hand , <ge> analysts say full <gb> 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout , which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares . <ge>
<gb> until recently , <ge> Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization <gb> by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets <ge> .
without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets , experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly <gb> , but could distract from a wave of 777X sales <ge> .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus <gb> that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies <ge> .
the antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream <gb> , neutralising them before they reached the brain , preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit <ge> .
<gb> but <ge> mice who had not been given the vaccine <gb> &quot; <ge> chilled out , <gb> &quot; say the researchers , <ge> a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains .
<gb> but <ge> the cost of the new vaccine is <gb> likely to be far <ge> lower <gb> , because it turns liver cells into antibody factories <ge> .
Prof Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette <gb> , preventing nicotine addiction <ge> .
&quot; they will know if they start smoking again , they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine <gb> , and that can help them kick the habit , &quot; he said <ge> .
former NSW minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing maritime leases policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid <gb> , who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land <ge> .
<gb> it &apos;s now investigating allegations <ge> Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid &apos;s secret interest <gb> in the properties , after evidence given by Mr Tripodi &apos;s former deputy chief of staff , Lynne Ashpole , on Thursday <ge> .
<gb> during years of discussions starting in 2005 <ge> the government had been pushing for the leases <gb> to go to public tender <ge> .
Mr Tripodi <gb> , who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009 , <ge> was initially in favour of public tenders .
<gb> but <ge> he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid <gb> , who Mr Tripodi acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease policy <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> was the matter being <gb> discussed in the course of these telephone conversations <ge> the development of the commercial lease policy <gb> , &quot; Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi <ge> .
<gb> Israeli <ge> warplanes struck a target inside the <gb> Syrian port <ge> city of Latakia <gb> Thursday night , a senior administration official confirms to Fox News <ge> .
historically , that meant it was white labour that had to be protected <gb> - and if some in the region saw echoes of that historic artifact , I wouldn &apos;t be surprised <ge> .
immigration Minister Brendan O &apos;Connor <gb> , who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smuggling , <ge> has implemented five of the recommended changes <gb> with the remainder under consideration <ge> .
<gb> meanwhile , <ge> a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack <gb> after arriving on an asylum boat at Christmas Island this week <ge> .
a study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the <gb> HS2 rail project has been announced by the UK government . <ge>
<gb> Scottish transport minister <ge> Keith Brown said he was &quot; excited &quot; to work with the UK government <gb> on the plan <ge> .
in June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link <gb> between London and the North of England from £ 32.7bn to £ 42.6bn. <ge>
this is to include the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London <gb> of three hours or less <ge> .
<gb> but it is also about connectivity , across the UK <ge> 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected <gb> because of HS2 <ge> .
<gb> for the Scottish government , <ge> Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to &quot; unequivocally &quot; back Scotland &apos;s inclusion in the HS2 network .
<gb> Mr Brown said : &quot; <ge> high speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland <gb> , but also adds Scotland &apos;s economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
so we are excited to work in partnership with the UK Government <gb> to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland , creating benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning <ge> .
I look forward to reviewing the report of the investigation <gb> with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps <ge> .
Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tablets and smart phones during take-off and landing <gb> despite moves in the US to loosen regulations covering the devices <ge> .
Australian carriers are looking at the decision <gb> , which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements , <ge> but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures .
the issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety <gb> is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members <ge> .
Virgin <gb> , which has already been talking to CASA about extending the use its in-flight wi-fi entertainment system , <ge> was amenable to a change <gb> but said it would take its lead from the regulator <ge> .
<gb> &quot; our current policy is that <ge> electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing <gb> and we have no immediate plans to change that , &quot; it said <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers <gb> and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA &apos;s decision and the reasons behind it <ge> .
for US carriers , the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline <gb> and will depend on the age of their fleet <ge> .
carriers will need to prove their planes can tolerate radio interference <gb> from mobile devices as well as revise manuals , training materials , carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefings <ge> .
<gb> &quot; once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet , <ge> it can allow passengers to use <gb> handheld , <ge> lightweight electronic devices <gb> such as tablets , e-readers , and smartphones-at all altitudes , &quot; the FAA said <ge> .
the group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely stowed <gb> under seats or in overhead bins during take-off and landing <ge> .
the south stand <gb> , on the other hand , where the most loyal - and the loudest - of BVB fans stand , <ge> was initially unusually quiet <gb> : no singing and no battle cries <ge> .
<gb> and right <ge> at the front <gb> , on the stand , <ge> a single large flag with the text &quot; Stadium Ban Section &quot; blew in the wind .
even stadium announcer <gb> , <ge> Norbert Dickel <gb> , speaking once again of the successful results in recent days - the derby victory , the win against Arsenal , the contract extension of coach Jörgen Klopp - <ge> did not raise spirits .
<gb> as always , <ge> the south stand was left until the end <gb> , and finally the stand resumed its usual role as the loudest section of the stadium <ge> .
<gb> immediately before the local district derby against FC Schalke 04 , <ge> some of the travelling BVB fans fired flares into the crowds of spectators and onto the pitch <gb> - and in so doing almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller <ge> .
&quot; there will be massive impact for the entire Ultra movement , <gb> &quot; announced the BVB Chairman on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt <ge> .
<gb> as an immediate measure , <ge> Watzke prohibited the Ultras <gb> from organising choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart <ge> .
<gb> in addition , <ge> the Ultras were given the option of several different punishments <gb> - they now have until Tuesday to decide which one to accept <ge> .
<gb> at a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore , <ge> Janani Amirthalinga is swapping a gold bangle , ring and pair of earrings <gb> to pay her daughters &quot; school fees <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> my husband and I have just bought a house <gb> so all my money &apos;s stuck there , &quot; Mrs Amirthalinga says <ge> .
<gb> even though she earns S $ 3,000 ( $ 2,400 ) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well , <ge> the monthly family income is insufficient <gb> , she says <ge> .
pawning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash <gb> - S $ 1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga &apos;s case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans <ge> .
typically pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent <gb> , just above the 15.4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary <gb> , and can arrange loans faster than banks <ge> .
<gb> hence <ge> millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops <gb> as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning household and consumer debt <ge> .
this week Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s <gb> , the rating agency , <ge> cited increasing household leverage <gb> , mainly from rising mortgages , <ge> as a risk factor <gb> for Asian banks &quot; creditworthiness <ge> .
economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt <gb> in Thailand , which this week narrowly emerged from technical recession <ge> .
historically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pawn personal belongings <gb> , as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery <ge> .
<gb> in Singapore , about <ge> 70 per cent of items pawned at the city-state &apos;s 200 pawn outlets are gold .
people are saying <gb> &quot; <ge> the gold price looks good <gb> , let &apos;s pawn grandma &apos;s gold chain and get it back next month <ge> .
in Thailand <gb> the largest pawnshop operator , <ge> EasyMoney <gb> , <ge> has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers <gb> using its outlets in recent months <ge> .
<gb> while some <ge> discount lenders have come under fire <gb> for high interest rates , Ms Yeah says that not only does pawning offer cheaper rates than other lenders , it also does not add directly to debt <ge> .
<gb> &quot; customers are mortgaging items that they already own , and <ge> monetising personal assets does not increase household debt <gb> , &quot; she says <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> they include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments <gb> , or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs , &quot; says Ms Yeah <ge> .
the Federal Government insists a $ 325 million rescue package for Tasmania &apos;s ailing health system <gb> has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can &apos;t waste the funds <ge> .
Federal Health Minister <gb> Tanya Plibersek <ge> has announced the Commonwealth is taking <gb> &quot; <ge> urgent action <gb> &quot; <ge> to head off a crisis <gb> caused by the island state &apos;s aging population , higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints <ge> .
there &apos;s also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston <gb> , better after-hospital care , medical specialist training , mental health services and the rollout of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> these investments respond to the ideas that front-line clinicians have told me will be the best ways to tend to Tasmania &apos;s health system <gb> , &quot; Ms Plibersek said <ge> .
a three-person commission will be set up <gb> to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible <ge> .
Mr Wilkie today said the $ 325 million would count for little <gb> &quot; unless it &apos;s followed by genuine reform to put Tasmania &apos;s public health system on a more sustainable footing <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
he nevertheless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance <gb> which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ripped $ 430 million out of its health system <gb> , &quot; he told ABC TV <ge> .
you can &apos;t have a state government ripping out almost half-a-billion dollars <gb> and the Commonwealth put in $ 300 million and pretend it &apos;s a good news day <ge> .
<gb> Mr Dutton called on Ms Plibersek to guarantee that <ge> not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .
<gb> unfolding in 1760s France , it tells the grim story of Suzanne , <ge> a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family .
<gb> when she rebels , <ge> she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a wantonly sadistic Mother <gb> Superior and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another <ge> .
the completion of <gb> what is essentially the initial stage of <ge> destruction is a significant milestone in <gb> an ambitious <ge> timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus &apos; chemical weapons by mid-2014 .
the country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons <gb> including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin <ge> .
the announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira , which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites <gb> , reported the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights <ge> .
the activist group <gb> , which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria , <ge> said Thursday that 120,296 people have died .
on the government side , it said 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad &apos;s armed forces <gb> , 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants <ge> .
<gb> also <ge> among the dead it said were 2,202 army defectors and <gb> some <ge> 5,375 opposition fighters <gb> , many of them foreigners <ge> .
Assad &apos;s troops have been battling rebels <gb> , many of them linked to al-Qaida groups , in Safira for weeks <ge> .
<gb> earlier this week , <ge> the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work <gb> , visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus <ge> .
<gb> on Thursday , OPCW said the two locations were , according to Syria , &quot; abandoned and ... <ge> the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites <gb> , which were inspected <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> it was not immediately clear if <ge> the facility in Safira was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were not able to visit .
Syria has submitted a plan for <gb> the total <ge> destruction of its chemical weapons <gb> that has to be approved next month by the OPCW &apos;s executive committee <ge> .
&quot; I salute the fortitude and courage you &apos;ve all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization , <gb> &quot; the watchdog &apos;s director-general , Ahmet Uzumcu , said in comments released by the OPCW <ge> .
<gb> now in its third year , <ge> the civil war pits the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad &apos;s government and its security forces <gb> , which are stacked with members of his Alawite sect , an offshoot of Shiite Islam <ge> .
<gb> in other developments , the Observatory &apos;s chief Rami Abdurrahman said <ge> there had been a strong explosion <gb> Wednesday <ge> inside an air defense facility <gb> in Syria &apos;s coastal province of Latakia <ge> .
survivors <gb> and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing <ge> have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters <gb> to face justice , saying Umar Patek should face a firing squad <ge> .
Patek <gb> , who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South-East Asia &apos;s most wanted , <ge> was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail <gb> for his role in building the explosive devices used in the bombing <ge> .
the 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in <gb> the popular tourist <ge> area of Kuta <gb> which left 202 people dead , including 88 Australians , and injured scores more <ge> .
he was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges <gb> , including a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 <ge> .
prosecutors had demanded a life sentence <gb> , although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the &quot; Demolition Man &quot; for his reputation as a master bomb-maker be sentenced to death <ge> .
he lapsed into a month-long coma in the wake of the bombing <gb> , and &quot; died &quot; three times while on life support <ge> .
Mr Hughes said Patek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell responsible for the carnage <gb> - Amrozi , Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago <ge> .
he had avoided capture for almost a decade <gb> but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad , where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later <ge> .
<gb> during the trial , <ge> an FBI agent testified that <gb> intelligence reports had revealed <ge> Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links <gb> between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda <ge> .
the verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year <gb> , which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia <ge> .
how fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline <gb> , FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference <ge> .
<gb> &quot; depending on the condition of the plan , <ge> we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon <gb> , &quot; the FAA said in a statement <ge> .
<gb> currently , <ge> passengers are required to turn off their <gb> smartphones , tablets and other <ge> devices <gb> once a plane &apos;s door closes <ge> .
they &apos;re not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet <gb> and the captain gives the go-ahead <ge> .
most new airliners <gb> and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes <ge> are expected to meet the criteria .
<gb> but <ge> connecting <gb> to the Internet to surf , exchange emails , text or download data <ge> will <gb> still <ge> be prohibited <gb> below 10,000 feet , the agency said <ge> .
<gb> last month , <ge> National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker <gb> , a CBS News national transportation safety expert , <ge> said that cell phones are still considered a risk .
an industry advisory committee <gb> created by the FAA to examine the issue <ge> recommended <gb> last month <ge> that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices .
critics <gb> such as Sen. Claire McCaskill , D-Mo . , <ge> contend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions .
some studies indicate <gb> as many as <ge> a third of passengers <gb> forget or <ge> ignore directions to turn off their devices .
the FAA began restricting passengers &apos; use of electronic devices in 1966 <gb> in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios , the high-tech gadgets of their day <ge> .
new airliners <gb> are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also <ge> designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference .
the vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines <gb> , Huerta said <ge> .
other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots <gb> to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems , <ge> and most of those reports are very old .
<gb> however , <ge> the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility .
a travel industry group welcomed the changes <gb> , calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology <ge> .
the water rail was put on a helicopter to Aberdeen last month <gb> before being nursed back to health by the Scottish SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa <ge> .
<gb> centre manager Colin Seddon said : &quot; <ge> this water rail was likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who got caught up in strong winds over the North Sea . <gb> &quot; <ge>
business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together <gb> and define what the UK &apos;s wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU <ge> .
<gb> we found that <ge> the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe <gb> , focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagnate <ge> .
this finding <gb> , which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups , <ge> shows that business is pushing for a &quot; meaningful change <gb> &quot; that brings powers back to the UK <ge> .
<gb> the Prime Minister should be in no doubt : <ge> this poll shows that British business backs his plan <gb> for renegotiating the terms of Britain &apos;s membership of the EU <ge> .
a better deal for British business is <gb> possible , and increasingly <ge> necessary as the eurozone embarks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in Britain <gb> and , as the findings of our poll show , for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels &quot; regulatory approach <ge> .
a contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine <gb> , which hosts most of Russia &apos;s gas for Europe , <ge> adds a layer of risk to conventional routes <gb> , officials say <ge> .
<gb> Miller said <ge> the direct connection to Bulgaria <gb> , a member of the European Union , <ge> means geopolitical risks <gb> associated with transit countries are eliminated &quot; forever <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream <gb> at a discounted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2015 <ge> .
this was the message of the 9th &apos; Immobilientag &apos; <gb> ( Property Day ) <ge> organised by the Börsen Zeitung <gb> ( stock exchange newspaper ) <ge> .
the German property markets are benefiting from the country &apos;s economic strength and general conditions <gb> which , compared with the rest of Europe , are very competitive <ge> .
<gb> the extent to which <ge> German commercial properties are sought after is evident <gb> in the transaction volumes , said Ulbrich <ge> .
<gb> in the first three quarters of this year , <ge> there was an increase of 31 % <gb> compared to the same period the year before <ge> .
the FAA is easing restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets <gb> on airplanes - though chatting on cellphones will still be prohibited <ge> .
<gb> rather than being rattled by the U.S. government shutdown , <ge> investors kept their focus on what <gb> probably <ge> matters more : the Federal Reserve .
the California woman plans to challenge <gb> what may be a first-of-its-kind citation <ge> , saying the Internet-connected eyewear makes navigation easier .

two YMCA NSW employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011 <gb> , the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard <ge> .
<gb> Mr Hare told Gail Furness , counsel assisting the Commission , <ge> he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one .
he conceded the YMCA &apos;s opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate <gb> in claiming &quot; there have been external audits of the YMCA that have recognised the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> earlier this year <ge> Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys <gb> during the two years he worked at the YMCA <ge> .
but Mr Hare rejected the suggestion the YMCA had a cultural problem <gb> which prevented staff from reporting Lord &apos;s breaches of child safety <ge> .
staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children <gb> , babysitting them privately , having them sit on his lap , saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone <ge> .
<gb> Mr Hare said <ge> the decision <gb> to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged <ge> was made by YMCA general manager of children &apos;s services Liam Whitley .
he said there were &quot; serious problems <gb> &quot; in recruitment , screening , induction , training and supervision of staff <ge> .
Tony Blair said he &apos;d seize the chance to return as Britain &apos;s prime minister <gb> - but acknowledges a comeback is unlikely <ge> .
<gb> in an interview overnight to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , <ge> the 59-year-old aired his views on various domestic policies .
the inseparable pair - who are the same height - were commended for appearance <gb> , behaviour and style at the annual contest run by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre , in Rudry near Cardiff <ge> .
<gb> taking to the stage against men and women in smart bowler hats , <ge> he tipped his <gb> flat <ge> cap <gb> at a jaunty angle <ge> and paraded <gb> two-year-old <ge> Toffee around the ring .
<gb> they were up against all comers but <ge> the two of them walked off with the gold cup <gb> and rosette <ge> .
<gb> it was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and <ge> we were all ecstatic when he won .
the youngster , from the village of Nantyglo , near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells <gb> , who has been showing horses for more than 10 years <ge> .
Fenton is animal mad <gb> - he loves horses , tractors and farms and has got two chickens which he looks after <ge> .
the way he has started he &apos;ll be at the Horse of the Year show <gb> before long - <ge> and <gb> I &apos;m sure <ge> he &apos;ll do well .
<gb> a spokesman for the annual horse show said : &quot; <ge> Fenton is only three but he knows how to handle his pony . <gb> &quot; <ge>
they look for good teamwork between the pony and the handler <gb> - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring <ge> .
a Chinese newspaper that made a front-page appeal for the release of a reporter accused of defamation is to be overhauled <gb> , a press regulator says <ge> .
<gb> but Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that <ge> he had taken bribes to fabricate stories about a part state-owned company .
the &quot; rectification &quot; order came from the Guangdong Administration <gb> of Press and Publication , Radio , Film and Television <ge> .
<gb> a preliminary investigation showed that <ge> Yangcheng Evening News Group &apos;s New Express had published several untrue reports <gb> about listed company Zoomlion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013 <ge> .
<gb> it said it had decided to <ge> &quot; impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by revoking his reporter &apos;s license . &quot;
<gb> after he was detained , <ge> his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release <gb> , saying it backed his journalism <ge> .
<gb> &quot; in this case <ge> I &apos;ve caused damages to Zoomlion and also the whole news media industry <gb> and its ability to earn the public &apos;s trust , &quot; <ge> he told state broadcaster CCTV .
<gb> following Mr Chen &apos;s apology , <ge> New Express issued a front-page apology <gb> , saying it had failed to properly check his reports <ge> .
<gb> one of the most sophisticated <ge> drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found <gb> , complete with its own lighting , ventilation and electric rail systems <ge> .
us authorities described <gb> the four foot by three foot <ge> tunnel as <gb> one of <ge> the most sophisticated <gb> secret passages <ge> they have <gb> ever <ge> discovered .
the tunnel <gb> , which zigzags the length of nearly six football pitches , <ge> links warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico and San Diego , USA .
authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine <gb> in connection with the tunnel &apos;s discovery , according to court records <ge> .
some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico &apos;s marijuana harvest in October <gb> , which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers <ge> .
in 2010 , authorities found a roughly <gb> 700-yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two San Diego warehouses . <ge>
in an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , <gb> which is to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , <ge> Bloom said <gb> , &quot; <ge> sometimes life doesn &apos;t go exactly as we plan <gb> or hope for <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> for while vegetarians allow themselves to consume cream tarts , ice cream or a strong Edam , <ge> these indulgences are off the menu for vegans .
<gb> milk , cheese , egg - alongside avoiding meat and fish , <ge> vegans refrain from eating all products of animal origin <gb> - even honey is not permitted <ge> .
<gb> &quot; however , <ge> it wasn &apos;t just the diet that convinced me , but also my choice of shoes <gb> , &quot; said Proctor , who prefers artificial leather over normal leather <ge> .
<gb> rather than missing burgers , scrambled eggs or gummi bears , <ge> the vegan has quickly discovered entirely new products that really inspire him .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the temptation factor is a decisive factor in causing many to quickly give up , similar to with smoking <gb> , &quot; says Proctor , providing a comparison <ge> .
<gb> for example , when attending a barbecue party , <ge> Proctor brings aubergines , mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages .
<gb> &quot; because animals are fed on fodder instead of grazing , <ge> it is dubious whether the vitamin B12 content in meat sold in freezers is actually high , &quot; commented Proctor .
<gb> &quot; <ge> in home cooking , there is much to be discovered <gb> - with a few minor tweaks you can achieve good , if not sometimes better results , &quot; said Proctor <ge> .
<gb> margarine in place of butter , a little more baking powder and bicarbonate of soda in place of egg - <ge> Proctor has even managed to astonish his in-laws with his vegan cheese cakes .
<gb> &quot; should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? &quot; - as a vegan <ge> you have to be tactful in such matters .
and on closer observation , the everyday world does not appear quite so &apos; un-vegan &apos; <gb> - and vegans are not quite as limited in their everyday lives as is commonly assumed <ge> .
<gb> &quot; if enough requests are made , <ge> they will perhaps be inclined to expand their menus <gb> , &quot; he hopes <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> meat dishes <gb> , on the other hand , <ge> are exclusive <gb> , in the truest sense of the word , <ge> as they rule others out <gb> , &quot; assessed Proctor <ge> .
<gb> OInce you come to understand that peanuts , in particular , may also contain animal additives as a colourant , <ge> people seem to quickly lose courage when following a code of ethics <gb> with so many hurdles and pitfalls <ge> .
on the other eleven options markets , <gb> including two also operated by Nasdaq OMX , <ge> business continued as normal .
the most recent incident is the latest in a series of both small and large breakdowns <gb> suffered by the stock exchange operator <ge> .
<gb> as recently as last Tuesday <ge> , the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for one hour due to data transfer errors .
<gb> first of all , US investment bank <ge> Goldman Sachs sent large quantities of incorrect purchase orders <gb> to the options markets due to technical problems <ge> .
<gb> as a result , <ge> the stock exchange operators required almost an entire day to look through and delete the orders .
<gb> during the subsequent collision , <ge> the pedestrian was thrown against the wall of the building , and then fell onto the ground <gb> , suffering a laceration to the head that measured around 15 centimetres in length <ge> .
Btitish police served an extradition notice today on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange <gb> , who has taken refuge in Ecuador &apos;s embassy in London and requested asylum <ge> .
Scotland Yard said they had served a &quot; surrender notice &quot; on the 40-year-old Australian requiring him to appear at a police station <gb> , adding that failure to do so would make him further liable to arrest <ge> .
Scotland Yard has <gb> &quot; <ge> served a surrender notice upon a 40-year-old man <gb> that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choosing , &quot; a spokesman said <ge> .
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden <gb> to the United States to face possible espionage charges , after releasing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website <ge> .
<gb> &quot; but <ge> this move could make some foreign investors reticent to buy property in London <gb> or current owners reluctant to sell , &quot; he added <ge> .
<gb> scientists have shed more light on how <ge> the movements of a dog &apos;s tail are linked to its mood .
<gb> earlier research had revealed that <ge> happy dogs wag their tails more to the right <gb> ( from the dog &apos;s point of view ) , while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish <ge> .
<gb> it will probably not be long before we understand <ge> why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other
<gb> but <ge> when they spotted a tail veer <gb> predominantly to the left ( again from the tail-swishing dog &apos;s point of view ) <ge> , their heart rates picked up <gb> and they looked anxious <ge> .
<gb> Prof Vallortigara said he didn &apos;t think that <ge> the dogs were intentionally communicating <gb> with each other <ge> through <gb> these <ge> movements .
<gb> instead , he believes that they <ge> dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn &apos;t feel worried about .
<gb> the researchers say <ge> the findings could give owners , vets and trainers a better insight into their animal &apos;s emotions .
<gb> dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw , a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol &apos;s school of veterinary science , said <ge> this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines .
<gb> last year a team from the University of Lincoln found <ge> that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog .
<gb> however , given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded , <ge> it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other .
the band &apos;s announcement came after they were forced to similarly postpone a gig <gb> at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday <ge> .
Pope Francis will create new cardinals <gb> of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 22 , the Vatican announced Thursday <ge> .
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church below the pope <gb> , and they &apos;re the ones who elect popes , so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> once a cardinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pope <gb> -- this falls to a group of 120 &quot; cardinal electors <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> in a statement announcing the news , <ge> Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals <gb> , known as a consistory <ge> .
<gb> Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February , <ge> the number of cardinal electors was likely to have dropped .
<gb> he said <ge> usually a pope would name as many cardinals as was needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 <gb> and as many cardinals aged over 80 as he wanted <ge> .
<gb> the cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals , a <ge> group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church .
Valero said popes typically elevated bishops from large places to the position of cardinal <gb> but that Francis was &quot; full of surprises -- so we don &apos;t know who he &apos;ll name <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
general Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks <gb> to repair a problem with the manual reclining seatback , according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday <ge> .
&quot; if the vehicle is struck from behind , the head restraint may not properly protect occupants , increasing the risk of injury , <gb> &quot; according to the notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website <ge> .
GM &apos;s truck roll-out began in June <gb> and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring <ge> .
NHTSA could not review the owner notification letter due to the <gb> 16-day government shutdown , which tempered auto sales growth in October . <ge>
sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks <gb> , which were redesigned for the 2014 model year , <ge> were up about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year <gb> , GM said on Friday <ge> .
it &apos;s a book that I thought would uplift me <gb> during the doldrums of second-year medical school , and renew in me a sense of hope <ge> .
it &apos;s called &quot; The Audacity to Win <gb> , &quot; and it &apos;s a memoir of Barack Obama &apos;s 2008 presidential campaign <ge> .
it &apos;s hard to remember those days of optimism <gb> -- they seem a distant memory , a sad reminder of opportunities gone by <ge> .
moreover , I believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward <gb> : immigration reform , a public option for health care , and closing the base at Guantanamo Bay , among others <ge> .
<gb> but , <ge> after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration <gb> to colleagues and peers <ge> , I &apos;ve reached a limit <gb> to the explanations that I can provide <ge> .
it cannot account for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki <gb> , an American citizen , <ge> without a trial <gb> , nor shirking public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns <ge> .
it cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House &apos;s efforts <gb> to silence the media <ge> are the <gb> &quot; <ge> most aggressive <gb> ... since the Nixon Administration <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> if , at 18 years old , I was supposed to figure out that <ge> governance may contradict the political campaigns that precede it .
<gb> obviously , <ge> elective office <gb> isn &apos;t a predictable course , as the opposing political party and random events , such as the Newtown massacre , will shape our public conversation . <ge>
<gb> yet , of all of the examples that I have listed above , <ge> they largely seem to be of the administration &apos;s own choosing .
Mitt Romney presented a confusing <gb> and unrefined <ge> alternative who could not seem to lock down his <gb> policies or his <ge> positions .
<gb> at a post-mortem campaign meeting , <ge> he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause .
billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest <gb> over his parental leave scheme because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit from it <ge> .
the mining magnate , who is in a dispute about paying a $ 6 million carbon tax bill <gb> , made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict <ge> .
the Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate <gb> that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are axed <ge> .
why is it that we shouldn &apos;t have a system where you can walk in <gb> , punch your details into a computer , vote immediately <ge> and have a result at 6.30 <gb> that night <ge> ?
the Electoral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting <gb> and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand <ge> .
Mr Palmer <gb> , 59 , <ge> said his policies included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast <gb> and he would take &quot; very seriously &quot; his new job <ge> .
the two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended <gb> in the widening probe that echoes the Libor interbank lending manipulation scandal <ge> .
<gb> last month , <ge> people close to the situation said that RBS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regulator <gb> , the Financial Conduct Authority , sent to and from a former trader <ge> .
<gb> this trader , <ge> Richard Usher <gb> , <ge> left RBS in 2010 <gb> and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan <ge> .
Rohan Ramchandani , <gb> head of European spot trading at Citi , <ge> went on leave <gb> this week <ge> , while Matt Gardiner <gb> , a former senior currencies trader at Barclays and UBS , <ge> was suspended by Standard Chartered <gb> this week <ge> .
Mr Usher &apos;s instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup <gb> , people close to the situation said <ge> .
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees <gb> after the Swiss regulator , FINMA , said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks <ge> .
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal probes <gb> or received requests for information from regulators , said people familiar with the situation <ge> .
some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate <gb> , but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true <ge> .
the news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange <gb> traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $ 6m loss late last year <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained <gb> , &quot; Credit Suisse said <ge> .
<gb> a group belonging to the &quot; Schweizer Wiese &quot; <ge> citizen &apos;s initiative has given the hoarding on the Bechtle plot <gb> on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb a face-lift <ge> .
the planned covering of the dilapidated house <gb> to the rear of the plot <ge> was not permitted for safety reasons <gb> , as the premises were at risk of collapsing <ge> .
Alfred Abel <gb> , who currently manages the site , <ge> arranged the <gb> &apos; <ge> face-lift <gb> &apos; <ge> in cooperation with his colleague <gb> , Reinhard Domke , from the citizen &apos;s initiative <ge> .
<gb> before the citizen &apos;s initiative project , <ge> a banner with the message &quot; We are in favour &quot; was put up .
<gb> however , <ge> this did little to distract the 20 or so members of the citizen &apos;s initiative from their project .
<gb> in so doing <ge> they wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Schweizer Wiese <gb> - should the huge project one day fail <ge> .
&quot; there is currently a dangerous trend , with Mane and Alan being dubbed as <gb> &apos; <ge> divers <gb> &apos; , &quot; he said at a press conference in Salburg on Thursday , in defence of the two tricky offensive players <ge> .
<gb> Harkam also played &quot; his part &quot; in the <ge> escalation between Salzburg Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig Trainer Adi Hütter after the game .
<gb> in a major victory for the Obama administration , the US Supreme Court today ruled <ge> Barack Obama &apos;s <gb> signature <ge> health care law is constitutional .
chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court <gb> while Justices Scalia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy dissented <ge> .
the court <gb> also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700 page law , and <ge> further held that the health care law &apos;s requirement <gb> that states increase Medicaid eligibility or else lose all federal Medicaid funding <ge> is not unconstitutionally coercive .
the law was vigorously opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season <gb> , including presumptive nominee Mitt Romney <ge> .
due to the low level of sunshine , from autumn until spring the village of Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley normally languishes in the shadows <gb> of the surrounding mountains <ge> .
<gb> up until now , <ge> those hungry for sunshine <gb> in the winter <ge> had to travel <gb> to a nearby peak by cable car <ge> .
<gb> ten years ago , <ge> local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal of directing the sun into the valley using mirrors .
<gb> after several years of debate , <ge> the Town Council finally approved the project , which cost 5 million krone <gb> ( around EUR 615,000 ) <ge> .
only the post boxes <gb> in front of the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and at Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld <ge> are still emptied .
whether there are still Sunday collections <gb> in Hofheim and Rosengarten <ge> is not addressed in the inquiry <gb> by the FDP <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the company is radically and unacceptably cutting back on this <gb> , despite the price increase for letters in January 2013 <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> at least the post boxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must <gb> still <ge> be emptied <gb> on Sundays , &quot; said Bittner and Röhrenbeck in unison <ge> .
<gb> it is also the case for the town centre that <ge> those citizens in particular who are not mobile must also be able to access a post box <gb> with a Sunday collection on foot <ge> .
<gb> in the Town Parliament , <ge> Röhrenbeck asked whether the Town Council was planning discussions with the postal service <gb> regarding this matter <ge> .
this increase will not , however , be the result of raised prices <gb> , but rather the fact that time interval permitted by parking meters and ticketing machines will be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes <ge> .
the Retail Committee of the Frankfurt Chamber <gb> of Industry and Commerce <ge> believes that this is &quot; not a good idea . &quot;
<gb> the option of <ge> parking right outside their businesses is <gb> &quot; <ge> an advantage to smaller retailers <gb> that must not be underestimated .. &quot; <ge>
<gb> the Verkehrsclub Deutschland ( German Traffic Club ) is of the opinion that <ge> an increase after two decades is &quot; completely appropriate and actually long overdue . &quot;
the Alb men stood on the other side of the net <gb> with what was undoubtedly a more experienced team <ge> .
they repeatedly missed the passes and <gb> attacks coming cleanly over the net from Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz and <ge> their blocking game was not up to scratch .
<gb> faced with this overwhelming and match-determining performance , <ge> the third set was won following a somewhat tame and spiritless performance <gb> , for a final score of 3 : 0 ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) <ge> .
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle <gb> , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pälchen , Stefan Räller , Simon Schenk <ge> and Eduard Schulz .
nerves on both sides , particularly when receiving the ball , resulted in errors and lost points <gb> ; there was even a lack of passing at times and at some critical moments overeagerness saw potential points wasted <ge> .
<gb> however , in this evenly matched game , <ge> the great physical effort of Marcus Blasutto &apos;s TSV team proved decisive <gb> in spite of tremendous commitment by both teams <ge> .
following suggestions from the population , the of the valley <gb> in the area of the cottage <ge> was to be cleared <gb> , said Mayor Helmut Kaiser <ge> .
<gb> according to Kaiser , many hikers refer to this area as the showpiece of the Schluchtensteig , where <ge> the landscape provides the ideal framework for fantastic views .
certain species <gb> , such as rare butterflies or grasshoppers , <ge> cannot get past barriers in the form of forest areas .
<gb> Tribukait said that <ge> she did not want to fail to <gb> use this opportunity to <ge> say a word in defence <gb> of the planned biosphere area <ge> .
<gb> one group of <ge> helpers were to take care of the clearance <gb> of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone wall <ge> .
the group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed a barrage of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google <gb> , the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction <ge> .
<gb> Samsung , <ge> Huawei and HTC all manufacture phones that operate on Google &apos;s Android <gb> operating system , which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products <ge> .
<gb> after losing out to Rockstar on the Nortel patents , <ge> Google went on to acquire Motorola Mobility for $ 12.5 billion <gb> , a deal driven partly by Motorola &apos;s library of patents <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> despite losing in its attempt to acquire <gb> the <ge> patents-in-suit at auction , Google <gb> has infringed and <ge> continues to infringe <gb> , &quot; the lawsuit said <ge> .
Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office <gb> but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political strife in Egypt <ge> .
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a &quot; new Egypt &quot; as he took the oath of office to become the country &apos;s first freely elected president <gb> , succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months ago <ge> .
<gb> at his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , <ge> Morsi also became the Arab world &apos;s first freely elected Islamist president <gb> and Egypt &apos;s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago <ge> .
hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building <gb> as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade <ge> .
he was given an official welcome by an army band <gb> that played the national anthem as he stood to attention <ge> .
his arrival was greeted with chants <gb> of , &quot; The army and the people are one hand , &quot; <ge> from the hundreds gathered in the university &apos;s main lecture room .
<gb> established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , <ge> Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups <gb> in the 1970s <ge> .
<gb> but by agreeing to take the official oath before the court , rather than before parliament as is customary , <ge> he is bowing to the military &apos;s will in an indication that the contest for power will continue .
this Friday evening , the &quot; Pump this party &quot; event will be taking place <gb> , while one day later , on Saturday evening , festivities will continue with an over-25s party <ge> .
the man <gb> from Lamprechtshausen <ge> wanted to replace a <gb> broken <ge> heating sensor <gb> on the external facade of a guest house <ge> .
as he was climbing the ladder , <gb> which was resting on the roof guttering , <ge> it slipped away and the man fell onto the concrete below .
the then 21-year-old had raped anene Booysen <gb> in February in an industrial estate in Bredasdorp , near Capetown <ge> .
during the trial , Kana admitted to having been in a bar <gb> with Booysen on the night of the attack <ge> .
he also admitted to beating and raping her <gb> , however he denied being responsible for the death of the girl <ge> .
the police had initially assumed that there were multiple attackers <gb> , however , they released two suspects from custody as the evidence against them was insufficient <ge> .
<gb> during the proceedings the public prosecution also emphasised that they were convinced that <ge> Kana was alone at the time of the attack .
rapes are almost part of everyday life in South Africa <gb> : there are around 64,000 reports of sexual assault every year <ge> .
<gb> this is almost ten times as many as in Germany , although with a population of 82 million people , <ge> Germany has a much higher number of residents than South Africa <gb> ( 50 million ) <ge> .
Uli <gb> , boss of the large ham factory in Schwarzwald , <ge> explained to Jumbo how the Bonndorf company <gb> , &quot; Adler , &quot; <ge> operates .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I would be curious what would happen if you were to measure Roberto Blanco <gb> , &quot; said Jumbo cynically <ge> .
the company has upgraded its full year profit forecast <gb> and is looking to record earnings from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom <ge> .
the travel company now expects its full year underlying profit before tax to be between $ 325 million and $ 340 million <gb> , compared with the $ 305 million to $ 315 million it previously forecast <ge> .
<gb> managing director Graham Turner said <ge> Flight Centre had made 8 per cent profit in the first half <gb> and had started the second half strongly especially in Australian and UK non-business travel <ge> .
<gb> &quot; year-to-date , <ge> our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record full-year earnings before interest and tax contributions <gb> , &quot; he said <ge> .
in Australia the leisure business rebounded during the second half <gb> which offset a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market <ge> .
its US business had recovered its losses during its seasonally weaker first half <gb> and was expected to deliver its third consecutive full year profit <ge> .
<gb> English literature <ge> courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play <gb> , a 19th century novel , Romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards <ge> .
the Department for Education is due to release the new syllabuses in English and maths tomorrow <gb> - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul <ge> .
<gb> in a separate move , Ofqual , <ge> the exams regulator , will unveil a shake-up of the structure of GCSEs <gb> , with a new grading system and less coursework <ge> .
<gb> by comparison , <ge> Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year <gb> and pupils do around 138 hours in Singapore <ge> .
the <gb> most beautiful <ge> rabbits <gb> of various breeds and colourings <ge> will be presented at the <gb> District <ge> Exhibition <gb> this weekend in the community centre <ge> .
<gb> here <ge> breeders from the clubs in the District of Soest will be exhibiting their best animals <gb> , while young private individuals from Wickeder are also showing their rabbits <ge> .
the rabbit show will <gb> , however , <ge> be open to all visitors from 10 : 00 a.m. on Saturday <gb> and from 10 : 00 a.m. until 3 : 30 p.m. on Sunday , which will be followed by the prize ceremony <ge> .
guests are also invited to take part in a tombola <gb> with impressive prizes and to sample some delicious food from the cafeteria <ge> .
the 46-year-old actress revealed her latest look <gb> while out and about in LA on Wednesday and shared a snap on her Twitter page <ge> .
<gb> it &apos;s the first time in 20 years that <ge> the blonde beauty has had short hair <gb> , and we &apos;re loving the demure change <ge> .
the Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant churches in Salem <gb> , the Salem Castle and the Lake Constance District Cultural Office <ge> .
<gb> at the forum , <ge> Johanna Rahner wants to address the question of how people today view the &quot; end times &quot; after death .
<gb> they have &quot; provided us with so many question marks , that <ge> we seem to have lost our exclamation marks . <gb> &quot; <ge>
associated with this is the matter of that longing <gb> , &quot; that dreams that everything will be good at the end <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
Johanna Rahner <gb> , born in 1962 in Baden-Baden , <ge> studied Catholic theology and biology <gb> from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert Ludwig &apos;s University in Freiburg <ge> .
a post-doctoral lecturing qualification in fundamental theology and ecumenical theology <gb> followed in 2003 at the Westfalian Wilhelm &apos;s University <ge> .
since 2010 , Johanna Rahner has occupied a Chair for Systematic Theology <gb> in the Institute for Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel <ge> .
Geislingen : more than 100 young Catholics from Kleiner Heuberg stand together <gb> in the confirmation of their profession of faith <ge>
<gb> in two services , <ge> 101 15 and 16-year-olds from the Am Kleinen Heuberg pastoral care unit were confirmed .
<gb> in the morning , <ge> the service was accompanied by the Laudato-Si Group <gb> , while the afternoon service featured &apos; The Spirit &apos; youth choir <ge> .
upon receiving the confirmation sacrament , the young people accepted their baptism <gb> and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit <ge> .
over recent months those being confirmed <gb> , under the direction of Deacon Reiner Dehner and the assistance of several church members , <ge> have been preparing for the special day .
<gb> in fantastic weather , <ge> 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to take on the circuit <gb> , over the hills and around the lake <ge> .
<gb> among the participants <ge> there were also numerous amateur cyclists who wanted the chance to practice their hobby in a competitive environment , in particular over the short distance of 15 kilometres with a 300 metre climb .
two top-class junior cyclists were also in the starting line-up for the competition <gb> : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of having achieved good positions at the German Championships <ge> .

<gb> but <ge> when they arrive , they receive a true heroes &apos; welcome <gb> : a feast , singing and dancing , and the best accommodations the community can offer <ge> .
others might receive crutches , a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates <gb> -- documentation that &apos;s required for school but that many impoverished families simply can &apos;t afford <ge> .
operations are usually done in a schoolhouse <gb> , town hall or home ; after the procedure , patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person <ge> .
<gb> with the group &apos;s generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment , <ge> Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning .
<gb> in addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon , <ge> Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde .
he is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization <gb> so he can go on these campaigns <ge> .
<gb> for medical and nursing students such as O &apos;Malley , <ge> who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle on his missions <gb> , it &apos;s a hands-on opportunity they &apos;d never get at home <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we &apos;ve been able to scrub in on surgeries <gb> where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle , &quot; O &apos;Malley said <ge> .
helping others live happier lives <gb> , fulfilling a promise he made to his father , <ge> is something that brings him great joy .

<gb> however , <ge> anyone who takes a closer look on parking level <gb> D2 will discover an archaeological site , cordoned off by metal railings . <ge>
ruins measuring five metres tall <gb> , made from stones around the size of the palm of your hand , <ge> are waiting to be discovered .
<gb> &quot; <ge> these are remnants of the Roman city wall <gb> , which was built in the second half of the first century A.D , &quot; explains Schulze <ge> .
before returning to daylight , Schulze has participants take a glance into a dark <gb> , 15-metre shaft on the upper parking level <ge> .

<gb> from the exhibition vestibule , <ge> a tunnel leads to the preserved Roman sewer <gb> , measuring around 120 metres in length <ge> .

the Public Prosecutor accused them of having stabbed and beaten three men <gb> in a car in Finowfurt , together with unknown accomplices <ge> .
<gb> at the time , a speaker for the court said that it could not be proven that <ge> the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud .

<gb> when asked , <ge> Public Prosecutor Stefan Golfier <gb> of the Frankfurt ( Oder ) Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office <ge> said that new evidence had come to light since the previous trial .
so what could be more natural <gb> than to casually pull into the next drive-through <ge> to pick yourself up a little treat ?
<gb> at the weekend in particular , <ge> discarded paper bags can be found at the side of the road and in car parks .

John Kerry <gb> has <ge> indicated a softening of the U.S &apos;s defensive stance on its surveillance programmes <gb> with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its spying has &quot; reached too far inappropriately <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the Secretary of State also admitted that he &apos;d been guilty <gb> , along with Barack Obama , of being on &quot; automatic pilot &quot; as incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA &apos;s spying activities emerged <ge> .
he <gb> then <ge> became the first <gb> high-ranking <ge> member of the <gb> U.S <ge> government to admit that US spying had crossed the line <gb> , but emphasised that no one &apos;s rights had been abused <ge> .
<gb> Mr Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force for good and that its <ge> surveillance operations had saved many lives .

<gb> and <ge> I &apos;m going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in combatting terrorism <gb> , notwithstanding their anger over these NSA programs <ge> .
<gb> other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that <ge> the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s cellphone <gb> and those of up to 34 other world leaders <ge> .
the national intelligence director , James clapper , defended spying on allies as necessary <gb> and said it &apos;s commonplace on both sides <ge> .
<gb> amid the uproar , <ge> Murphy said his office is arranging the congressional trip , expected to take place this year <gb> , and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers <ge> .
<gb> while Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships , <ge> he said some &quot; tough love &quot; will also be dispensed .
<gb> he said <ge> European leaders need to be honest <gb> with their own people <ge> about <gb> the kind of <ge> espionage programs <gb> they &apos;ve used for years themselves <ge> .

<gb> tunks told Sydney &apos;s Sunday Telegraph <ge> the whole family was &quot; extremely concerned &quot; about his daughter &apos;s welfare <gb> and wanted her back in Australia <ge> .
&quot; it &apos;s obviously been a worrying time but we &apos;re hopeful to have her back home <gb> safely as soon as possible , &quot; tunks said <ge> .
<gb> reports in Australia said that in the meantime , <ge> she was holidaying at the resort area of Krabi <gb> in Southern Thailand <ge> .
<gb> however , following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket , <ge> Thailand may also be looking to repair its battered tourist image <gb> , leading to an acquittal <ge> .
