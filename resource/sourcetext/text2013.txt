<gb> however , <ge> the Brennan Centre considers this a myth <gb> , stating <ge> that electoral fraud is rarer <gb> in the United States <ge> than the number of people killed by lightning .
<gb> unlike in Canada , <ge> the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections <gb> in the United States <ge> .
this phenomenon gained momentum following the <gb> November 2010 <ge> elections <gb> , which saw 675 new Republican representatives added in 26 States <ge> .
<gb> as a result , <ge> 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced <gb> in 2011 alone <ge> .
<gb> furthermore , <ge> these laws also reduce early voting periods <gb> , invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record <ge> .
<gb> over the past two years , <ge> they sponsored bills in 34 States to force voters to show a photo ID card .
<gb> it is important to note that , unlike Quebec , <ge> American citizens do not have a universal ID card <gb> such as the health insurance card <ge> .
<gb> on the other hand , <ge> these same States allow fishing or hunting club members <gb> , who vote more Republican , <ge> to use the cards <gb> issued by these clubs when they vote <ge> .
<gb> what is more , in 2011 <ge> Republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing the registration of voters <gb> on election day <ge> in eight States .
<gb> in addition , <ge> they limited the right <gb> of individuals and groups <ge> to provide assistance <gb> to voters wishing to register <ge> .
<gb> for example , during the 2004 general election , <ge> voter registration campaigns contributed to registering around 10 million citizens .
<gb> in addition , <ge> Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other States <gb> aimed at reducing the early voting period <ge> .
<gb> for example , <ge> during the 2008 general election in Florida , 33 % of early voters were African-Americans <gb> , who accounted however for only 13 % of voters in the State <ge> .
<gb> on the other hand , <ge> 76 % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
<gb> for example , <ge> only 16 <gb> out of 34 <ge> States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card .
<gb> however , <ge> the new rules put in place will <gb> undoubtedly <ge> make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote <gb> in 2012 . <ge>
democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws <gb> that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influencing the 2012 results in key States <ge> .
a 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed <gb> in the electoral college to win the Presidency <ge> .
<gb> it is too early to say with certainty that <ge> these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts <gb> on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections <ge> .
<gb> indeed , <ge> the PSA test sometimes shows erroneous results with false negative or even false positive results <gb> , which involve unnecessary medical interventions <ge> .
<gb> another study , this time a European one , concluded that <ge> there was a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who were not .
<gb> today , <ge> many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated <gb> because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening <ge> .
<gb> more and more , <ge> specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated .
<gb> but <ge> the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor <gb> to determine whether or not to take it <ge> .
<gb> despite the progress in research , <ge> the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way <gb> to reduce the risk of suffering from it <ge> .
<gb> &quot; if no more people smoked , <ge> this rate would increase to at least 50 % <gb> , &quot; says Andr√© Beaulieu , spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society <ge> .
<gb> for the Canadian Cancer Society , <ge> the fight against tobacco remains a priority <gb> , despite the decrease in the number of smokers <ge> .
<gb> encouraging data : <ge> 10 years after giving up smoking , the risk of dying from cancer drops by half .
they can increase the risks of cancer <gb> of the breast , colon and rectum , oesophagus , pancreas and uterus <ge> .
<gb> &quot; research shows that <ge> the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against colon cancer <gb> &quot; it is also said <ge> .
the announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer <gb> , and with good reason <ge> .
<gb> indeed , it is believed that <ge> this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe <gb> , no less <ge> .
<gb> also <ge> it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model <gb> - our best or &quot; less worse &quot; explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically <ge> .
we know <gb> without a shadow of a doubt <ge> that it is a new authentic particle <gb> , and greatly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model <ge> .
<gb> in our world , <ge> there is <gb> a fatally <ge> unavoidable law which states <gb> that <ge> two things cannot meet at the same place <gb> at the same time <ge> .
there &apos;s no way to break this rule <gb> - and don &apos;t try too hard , you &apos;ll go mad <ge> .
these bosons <gb> , it must be stressed here , <ge> are not all such exotic bugs as you might think .
<gb> in fact , <ge> if you can read this article , it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson <gb> : the photon , or the &quot; light particle &quot; which is the &quot; messenger &quot; of the electromagnetic force <ge> .
<gb> when , in fact , <ge> a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction <gb> , this &quot; disturbs &quot; the electromagnetic field in this specific place , rather <ge> like a pebble thrown in a pond .
the same applies to the Higgs boson <gb> , with the difference that it is another field , the Higgs field , which must be &quot; disturbed &quot; for the boson to appear <ge> .
<gb> which is why <ge> a huge particle accelerator <gb> like the one at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a 27km circumference ! - <ge> is needed to achieve such energy levels .
<gb> some , such as magnets , do so , but others don &apos;t - <ge> a piece of paper , for example , will never stick to a fridge .
<gb> and likewise , <ge> not all particles interact with the Higgs field <gb> : those that do so have mass , while the others ( such as the photon ) do not <ge> .
<gb> for science , <ge> it serves to check the validity of the Standard Model <gb> ( SM ) , and also allows physicians to examine any discrepancies between the observations and predictions of the SM <ge> .
a number of people <gb> , moreover , <ge> fervently hope that some will be found <gb> , because the slightest difference could open a door to a &quot; new physics &quot; and plug certain holes in the Model <ge> .
<gb> the <ge> repercussions <gb> of this research on the daily life of the man in the street <ge> are <gb> more <ge> difficult to predict , but it would be wrong to assume <gb> that <ge> there won &apos;t be any .
<gb> remember : in the very early 60s , the <ge> pioneers of the laser at Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution <gb> that would be triggered by their work <ge> .
<gb> for example , the same <ge> Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor <gb> in 1969 , during his work in optics <ge> .
this sensor <gb> , although this was not at all the original intention , <ge> now serves as an &quot; eye &quot; to all digital cameras worldwide <gb> , and earned him the Nobel physics prize in 2009 <ge> .
this does not <gb> of course <ge> mean that the activities <gb> of the LHC <ge> will <gb> necessarily <ge> transform our lives <gb> , but it does mean that , actually , you never know ... <ge>
the disease is doing its work : huge weakness which prevents him going to the toilet alone <gb> , and even eating alone <ge> .
courageous , he even manages to smile , talks to the strangers bustling around him <gb> , bringing him his medication , offering him a bath <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> what I want most is to be cured of my diarrhoea <gb> , it &apos;s humiliating &quot; he confided <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> during our lives , we learn that a man pisses standing up <gb> , &quot; says Pierre Brodeur , psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home <ge> .
<gb> because , in the opinion of a number of people working in palliative care , <ge> great moments occur at the very heart of such regression .
<gb> for Mrs A. , 89 years old , <ge> the worst fear is to die <gb> &quot; <ge> conscious and suffocating . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> I don &apos;t wish for anything more in life <gb> &quot; she says , before accepting having a mask put on to help her breathe <ge> .
she looks forward nevertheless , <gb> in the next few days , <ge> to a last visit by her son coming from Italy .
<gb> here , <ge> life continues under the best possible conditions <gb> , explains Dr Christiane Martel , one of the doctors at the home <ge> .
a person who is dying will accept being helped to drink brandy or Pepsi <gb> , whatever is their tipple <ge> .
<gb> &quot; for six months , <ge> there have always been three to five beds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years old <gb> &quot; says a concerned Dr Christiane Martel <ge> .
and a number of organisations <gb> , such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Palliative Care Society <ge> in Greater Montreal , specialise more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients .
<gb> since October , <ge> a manifesto <gb> , signed by palliative care luminaries including Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe , <ge> has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative .
<gb> according to Dr Christiane Martel , <ge> the <gb> Quebec <ge> health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to <gb> quality <ge> palliative care <gb> before it is accepted to proceed to euthanasia <ge> .
<gb> when I announced to my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment , <ge> she told me she regretted that I had given up fighting <gb> , she said <ge> .
Dr Martel believes that 90 % of patients asking to die thank care-givers <gb> for not having acceded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team <ge> .
<gb> according to Elsie Monereau , Palliative Care Director with the Palliative Care Society in Greater Montreal , <ge> patients are resistant to treatment against pain in 8 % of cases .
at the very end of life , physicians then often resort to palliative sedation <gb> , which is equivalent to putting the patient to sleep until the time of death , either sporadically or permanently <ge> .
<gb> but this does not necessarily mean &quot; I want you to euthanise me , &quot; <ge> it means &quot; I want to be relieved . &quot;
an &quot; industry &quot; which has cost Quebec taxpayers dearly <gb> , especially in the 1990s and 2000s <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> it is curious how the system is crumbling since we took drastic measures <gb> &quot; says Jacques Duchesneau ironically , a Quebec politician and former Montreal Chief of Police <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> since the inquiry opened <gb> in 2010 , he says <ge> , the Ministry of Transport <gb> alone reportedly <ge> saved a billion dollars on contracts <gb> , &quot; with certain people curbing their instincts to get a share <ge> !
the Charbonneau Commission &quot; has already brought down two mayors &quot; <gb> he adds , hoping that it will succeed in &quot; revealing the schemes behind the individuals . &quot; <ge>
the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit <gb> , created in 2011 , <ge> is also coupled with its army of government analysts <gb> , investigators , and auditors <ge> .
<gb> plus <ge> the <gb> &quot; marteau squad &quot; <ge> policemen <gb> who , since 2009 , <ge> have apparently led the Montreal &quot; sewer cartel &quot; <gb> to soft pedal on the inflation of contracts ... <ge>
<gb> in recent weeks , <ge> it has conducted a series of searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians <gb> , such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte , Mayor of a suburban town <ge> .
next on the list is <gb> apparently <ge> Gilles Vaillancourt , who has just resigned from his post as Mayor <gb> of Laval , third largest city in Quebec <ge> .
the latter caused a sensation by explaining the mechanics of the public contracts <gb> &quot; system &quot; to the commission <ge> .
Mr zambito has handed money out freely <gb> in the 2000s , giving over 88,000 Canadian dollars ( roughly 68,000 euros ) to provincial parties , especially the Liberals then in power <ge> .
other highway officials admitted having their palms greased by inflating invoices <gb> by 30 to 40 % , and by false add-ons <ge> .
<gb> then an organiser of the Mayor &apos;s party , <ge> Martin Dumont , accused Mr Tremblay of having deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money .
<gb> the wound is being cleaned , but <ge> Montreal would need its own investigative unit with ongoing monitoring <gb> , to avoid the return of these questionable practices <ge> .
<gb> estimating the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec at 70 % , he says dryly : &quot; <ge> I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> from my debut at the Clairefontaine INF pre-training centre to my transfer to Saint-Etienne , <ge> I &apos;ve always moved step by step .
today he has no equal in Ligue 1 <gb> , and he &apos;s one of the best coaches in Europe <ge> .
one of our main goals is the Champions League <gb> : we qualified for the last 16 in the right way <ge> .
<gb> first of all , <ge> we want to finish top in our pool <gb> , ahead of Porto , to have home advantage in the last 16 match <ge> .
<gb> even if big teams like Marseille , <ge> Lyon and Bordeaux are competing for the title <gb> , I think we have the weapons to win <ge> .
<gb> after <ge> we won 4-0 <gb> at home against Troyes <ge> and they still found things to blame us for <gb> , that &apos;s definitely a bit frustrating <ge> .
look at Manchester City who <gb> , for two seasons , <ge> have failed to qualify <gb> for the last 16 , despite also having spent huge amounts <ge> !
Thiago Silva <gb> , who is one of the best defenders in the world , also <ge> helps everyone else progress .
I &apos;ve learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine <gb> and I now owe it to myself to have exemplary behaviour <ge> .
did the good draw ( 1-1 ) snatched in Spain <gb> , on 16 October , <ge> represent a founding match ?
the opposite of current monetary exchanges <gb> , based on central banks , <ge> identified transactions and processing fees among the parties involved .
<gb> in addition , as often in these technologies , <ge> a political vision is palpable <gb> : the belief that the current monetary system , made up of banking monopolies , leads to financial crises <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> the European Central Bank <gb> ( <ge> ECB <gb> ) <ge> took an interest in it <gb> in a report on virtual currencies published in October <ge> .
<gb> with Bitcoin , <ge> all nodes in the network are both custodians of the book of accounts <gb> , auditors , currency issuers , and buyers and sellers <ge> .
<gb> using the contents of the file , <ge> it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of accounts <gb> , broadcast across the entire network <ge> .
it passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge issued to the computers <gb> , and the winner , a kind of interim central banker , will have the privilege of adding this extra line <ge> .
computers &quot; take &quot; the new transaction and add a number to it <gb> , then &quot; hash &quot; it all up <ge> .
<gb> once this number has been found , <ge> the other nodes can easily check that it is the right one .
the transaction is <gb> then indestructibly <ge> linked to the chain of all the other transactions <gb> ; any modification would alter the imprint <ge> .
&quot; the loophole used is not the protocol itself <gb> &quot; says Pierre Noizat reassuringly , who has just launched Paymium , a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network <ge> .
&quot; thirty thousand dollars were exchanged &quot; welcomes Jon Holmquist <gb> , who works for Coinabul , which converts bitcoins to gold <ge> .
Pierre Noizat , <gb> also <ge> author of an educational book on this currency , has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network .
the system is easy to implement by merchants <gb> , who do not need to install new terminals or software <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> it will take time for Bitcoin to become firmly established <gb> , but 2013 could be a turning point , &quot; he predicts <ge> .
the ECB , in its report , says it will reassess the various risks <gb> , currently regarded as high , in the event of the currency &apos;s success <ge> .
the Taliban is composed of foreign extremists , former leaders in refuge in Pakistan , but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces <gb> , like in the time of the Soviets <ge> .
they want to defend their traditions , <gb> both ancient and archaic , <ge> even though they have been joined by Jihadists , Pakistanis , Arabs , Uzbeks , Tajiks .
<gb> tolerated , sometimes assisted , by local insurgents , <ge> the latter will no longer be so when Westerners become more scarce .
the departure of French troops <gb> from the Nijrab base , which I observed from the top of hills of almond trees planted with French funding , <ge> was carried out in an orderly fashion .
their takeover <gb> of the country <ge> had been perceived <gb> then <ge> as a sort of liberation <gb> , a return to safety <ge> .
<gb> former Mujahidin , the <ge> Afghan Government and the <gb> current <ge> Taliban are allied <gb> in the desire <ge> to keep women in an inferior position .
they became profiteers , seizing government land <gb> to resell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan , benefiting from huge American outsourcing contracts <ge> .
the people <gb> , as I heard in the countryside , <ge> want a Government that is not made up of thieves .
roughly 65 % of the population is less than 25 <gb> ; Kabul now has 5 million people , a fifth of the total population <ge> .
it will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the obscurantism <gb> of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders <ge> .
all of them <gb> , including the armed opponents , <ge> are partial to mobile phones <gb> ; television , with its Turkish soap operas that show a modern world , is followed everywhere <ge> .
former commanders <gb> of the anti-Soviet struggle <ge> are <gb> already <ge> thinking about restoring provincial militias <gb> , which will escape the central power <ge> .
no industries have been re-established <gb> , no dams are in good condition , no major irrigation systems have been repaired <ge> .
with no energy <gb> to process the iron ore or copper on site , or means of transport to export it across the mountains , <ge> there is no mining .
one day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan <gb> , on which imports and exports largely depend , to restore normal relations <ge> .
these projects <gb> , involving large numbers of local labour , <ge> have helped to contain the insurgency : irrigation , wells , drinking water , reforestation , fruit trees , soil protection and increase in cultivable areas .
a much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions <gb> , which are very hard in these valleys often located over 2,000 metres above sea level <ge> .
while Egypt remains more divided <gb> than ever around the constitutional declaration , which temporarily grants him full powers <ge> , he has decided to go for broke .
<gb> taking everyone by surprise , <ge> he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text <gb> the following day <ge> .
<gb> just a week ago , <ge> the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish <gb> its work <ge> .
<gb> according to his opponents , <ge> the President is persevering in his &quot; autocratic delirium , &quot; continuing to &quot; go back on his word &quot; and &apos; trample the law . &quot;
<gb> his supporters affirm that <ge> this is the quickest way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis <gb> , by speeding up the transition process <ge> .
a very short period , which forces the Brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text <gb> , article by article , to the Egyptians <ge> .
<gb> for the President , <ge> it is <gb> also <ge> a way to achieve <gb> popular and <ge> democratic legitimacy <gb> while the dispute rages throughout the country <ge> .
particularly since a hasty vote smacks of an ultimatum to the Egyptian people <gb> : &quot; either you vote for my text , or I keep full powers , &quot; these powers supposedly expiring following adoption of the Constitution <ge> .
in mid-November , <gb> shortly before the constitutional declaration , <ge> they had slammed the door <gb> , feeling they had failed to assert their views <ge> .
commentators were also amused that one of the only diversions <gb> of the day <ge> was expressed with regard to <gb> ... <ge> the hour of prayer <gb> , some Committee members feeling that the Constituent Assembly clock was wrong <ge> .
the main focus of attention , article 2 , remains in the final analysis identical to that of the 1971 Constitution <gb> , stipulating that &quot; the principles of sharia are the main source of law <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the Salafist parties <gb> , for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim , <ge> were hoping to replace &quot; the principles &quot; by &quot; the rules <gb> , <ge> &quot; <gb> which would have allowed stricter application <ge> .
<gb> for the Islamists , <ge> the fact that this article was not amended is a guarantee of their goodwill <gb> and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society <ge> .
<gb> they refer in particular to <ge> article 220 <gb> , which <ge> grants Al-Azhar University an advisory role <gb> , with particular reference to verifying the conformity of the laws with sharia <ge> .
<gb> the liberals &apos; fears are also fuelled by the fact that <ge> the next Rector of the university will probably be much less moderate than the current one .
<gb> but <ge> he acknowledges that <gb> &quot; <ge> there may be some ambiguity regarding article 220 <gb> , because the terms used borrow from the religious vocabulary <ge> .
<gb> and the <ge> question could be asked in future to what extent civil judges are competent <gb> to pronounce on it <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> beyond its religious aspect , <ge> the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers <gb> it grants to the President of the Republic <ge> .
<gb> in accordance with the wishes of the military , <ge> the Defence budget review will be <gb> not <ge> submitted to <gb> Parliament , but to <ge> a National Defence Council .
nor will trials of civilians <gb> will <ge> be banned <gb> in military tribunals , as requested by associations for the defence of human rights <ge> .
the offence of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited <gb> , which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression , particularly for the press <ge> .
<gb> in addition , <ge> no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women <gb> , highlights HEBA Morayef , from Human Rights Watch <ge> .
AIF <gb> &#91; Argumenti i Fakti &#93; <ge> newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel .
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his magic <gb> : turned water into wine at a wedding , walked on water , calmed a storm , and filled the nets <ge> .
the Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem is erected at the site <gb> that , according to Christian legend , yielded the tree used to make the cross for Jesus &apos; crucifixion <ge> .
Jerusalem has the most holy places for the Jews as well <gb> - the Wailing Wall , which remained from a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD <ge> .
<gb> according to tradition , <ge> people of different faiths leave notes here with their wishes <gb> , which are then fulfilled <ge> .
it has ancient Qumran manuscripts and Dead Sea scrolls found in the caves of the Judean desert <gb> , along with about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artefacts <ge> .
its exhibits include a wide range of impressionists and expressionists <gb> like Monet , Pissarro , Renoir , Sisley , Cezanne , Matisse , Modigliani , Chagall , Picasso <ge> .
the fifth one is the Holocaust Museum <gb> or Yad Vashem <ge> in Tel-Aviv , which tells one of the most dramatic stories in history .
the most tragic section is the children &apos;s memorial <gb> , built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers <ge> .
there are three resort areas in Israel <gb> , located on the coasts of the Mediterranean , Red , and Dead Seas <ge> .
<gb> it is notable that <ge> one can swim in the Red Sea even in winter months <gb> , because the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air warms to 23 degrees <ge> .
<gb> incidentally , <ge> it is the most unusual sea in the world <gb> , located in the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below sea level <ge> .
its azure water is saline and easily keeps you afloat <gb> , even if you don &apos;t know how to swim <ge> .
they are preserved in the old section of Tel-Aviv <gb> - in the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean Sea <ge> .
<gb> according to legends , <ge> this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beauty Andromeda <gb> , with whom he lived a long and happy life <ge> .
<gb> they say , <ge> if you touch the walls on the street of your sign , fortune will come to you .
<gb> in Jaffa , <ge> you can meet newlyweds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for photo sessions .
<gb> and <ge> in Caesarea <gb> - the city of King Herod - <ge> you can walk around a Roman theatre <gb> , &quot; capture &quot; the Crusader fortress <ge> .
<gb> during the Roman period , <ge> Caesarea was the main city of Judea <gb> and the residence of Roman prefects , including Pontius Pilate <ge> .
a ticket for any type of city transportation costs 6 shekels <gb> , and you can ride for 1.5 hours with transfers <ge> .
many cafes , restaurants and hotels have only kosher food <gb> , with no pork , seafood , fish with no scales , or dishes that combine milk with meat <ge> .
car rental <gb> , depending on car type , <ge> costs from 37 <gb> ( Hyundai Getz ) <ge> to 188 <gb> ( Audi A6 , Volvo S80 ) <ge> dollars a day .
between January and October 2012 118,800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Holy Land <gb> , which is 51 % more than a similar figure in 2010 , before the removal of the visa regime on February 9 , 2011 <ge> .
<gb> while deputies and human rights activists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory language testing , <ge> the country already has scam artists who sell fake certificates .
a new law <gb> came into effect on December 1 , <ge> which obliges every migrant worker to pass a Russian language test .
<gb> for the moment , <ge> this law applies only to those who intend to work in services <gb> , housing and utility services , household services , and retail <ge> .
<gb> but with time - as promised by the Federal Migration Service - <ge> tests will become mandatory for all non-residents .
people who received education certificates and diplomas before the fall of the USSR <gb> in 1991 <ge> are also exempt under the law .
<gb> first of all , according to representatives of the migration service , <ge> this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from labour slavery .
<gb> only <ge> the system of organized selection will enable us to solve 90 % of the problems <gb> of foreign workers <ge> .
migrants <gb> without profession , education , who do not know Russian , who do not have a medical certificate <ge> start to have problems .
<gb> naturally , <ge> this is not so much their fault <gb> , <ge> but due to poverty <gb> : very few Turks , Uzbeks , and Tajiks can afford even a basic education <ge> .
if they have no status , there will be no testing <gb> , nor any official work in the future <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> they ask for a hundred or two for cigarettes <gb> , tea , &quot; Umed Khushkadamov , a citizen of Tajikistan , shared with journalists <ge> .
<gb> on the first day of the law &apos;s entry into effect <ge> it turned out that not only migrant registration documents can be fake .
<gb> naturally , <ge> they were not free for their owners <gb> : each of the migrants , who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for them <ge> .
it is two and a half times more than the process of official testing <gb> , which costs three thousand <ge> .
government officials <gb> and human rights activists <ge> agree that the main goal <gb> in the near future <ge> is to protect the system from corruption <gb> , so that the certificates could not just be bought <ge> .
<gb> for the moment , <ge> the authorities can promise migrant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course .
<gb> in addition , <ge> those who come without Russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people .
this is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents <gb> : click shots at weddings , where there were no casualties , and the massacre staged by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov , resulting in CLICK the death of seven people <ge> .
policemen want to prohibit the carrying of weapons in public places <gb> and raise the legal age of weapons licensing from 18 to 21 <ge> .
<gb> not everyone is happy that <ge> the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by &quot; tightening the screws . &quot;
an open letter appeared online , whose authors <gb> - representatives of different social rifle organizations - <ge> demand to abandon the &quot; senseless toughening . &quot;
<gb> authors of the open letter are certain that the <ge> toughening of the law <gb> in the area of civil weapons <ge> will not prevent the criminal from going to <gb> the &quot; <ge> black <gb> &quot; <ge> market .
<gb> nonetheless , <ge> the Ministry of the Interior asserts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control .
there are five such channels <gb> , explains retired colonel Viktor Baranets , who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for 10 years <ge> .
<gb> first : &quot; <ge> army or military loot <gb> , &quot; i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus <ge> .
<gb> Baranets explains that <ge> this covers weapons taken from police warehouses and those stolen directly from law enforcement agencies &apos; employees .
<gb> &quot; <ge> there are proven theories that some of the fires were intentional <gb> , in order to cover the shortage , &quot; says the former military man <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> there are so many private weapons factories now , which do not endure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market <gb> , including in Moscow , &quot; says the expert <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> there &apos;s production there <gb> , sometimes handmade ; <ge> and a mafia has formed <gb> , which has organized a stream , &quot; explains the former military man <ge> .
experts counted the approximate share of each of the sources of supply <gb> of illegal weapons to the &quot; black &quot; market <ge> .
experts analysed the reports of the Department of the Interior and Rosstat <gb> , criminology literature and open data from portals on weapons <ge> .
the overwhelming majority of illegal weapons <gb> , according to the researchers , <ge> comes from the military and security forces .
half of all arms on the black market are there &quot; because of officials <gb> , whose work is connected with weapons , &quot; states the report <ge> .
<gb> according to researchers &apos; data , <ge> 17 % of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas <gb> , 14 % is theft during production , 5 % is &quot; black archaeology <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> he takes it to the city and sells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines <gb> , &quot; he says <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the truth is that police are aware of everything <gb> , that is why periodically , when the crime detection rate is low , it conducts test purchases from illegal weapons merchants , &quot; says the consultant <ge> .
there are salesmen on labour markets <gb> , but one needs to &quot; come &quot; there conditionally &quot; from John Doe , who asked to tell that his daughter lost a tooth <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
according to Baranets , the buyer is not offered a pig in a poke <gb> - you can try out everything <ge> .
<gb> I , the potential client , am not just buying ; <ge> we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there .
<gb> &quot; I am given the opportunity to shoot , and <ge> when I am certain that the weapon is good , we begin to negotiate <gb> , &quot; describes the expert <ge> .
&quot; without a license , of course , &quot; asks user &quot; John <gb> &quot; ( name is changed ) <ge> .
<gb> I heard about this : <ge> normally the site is registered outside the area of applicability of the laws <gb> of Russia <ge> .
<gb> &quot; in response , <ge> a photo is sent with instructions on where the weapon is hidden <gb> , &quot; says Press Secretary of the Rights to Weapons non-governmental organization Dmitry Kislov <ge> .
<gb> Viktor Baranets confirms that <ge> after leaving a request on the site you can stay without a weapon and go to jail .
the Federal Security Service now spreads a big network of fake sites <gb> and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> people are like hungry fish after bait , <gb> and end in Siberia mining coal , &quot; - he says . <ge>
<gb> according to Dmitry Kislov from the Rights to Weapons organization , <ge> a Makarov gun can be acquired for 100-300 dollars .
<gb> right now , <ge> nobody is able to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or <gb> it is destined to <ge> fizzle out early .
actions began last week after Thanksgiving , on Black Friday <gb> , when massive sales drew millions of people in America , sometimes accompanied by clashes <ge> .
Walmart sells everything imaginable <gb> , from diapers , hunting rifles and car batteries , to vacuum cleaners , eggs and milk <ge> .
<gb> according to critics , <ge> Walmart can afford to sell the products cheaply <gb> partly because it pays little to its employees <ge> .
protesters <gb> on Black Friday demanded a salary increase and <ge> complained that the cost of medical insurance <gb> provided by the corporation <ge> went from 30 to 100 dollars a month .
scientists <gb> from the Berkeley University in California <ge> argue that if Walmart raises the average salary to 12 dollars / hour , it will cost the corporation 3.2 billion dollars .
if Walmart fully shifts the cost <gb> of increasing wages <ge> to the shoulders of consumers , each visit to the store will cost <gb> only <ge> 46 cents more .
<gb> Walmart supporters happily note that the <ge> protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage <gb> at all to the corporation <ge> .
black Friday continued in its stores <gb> from 8 in the evening on Thursday till midnight the next day , and during the period Walmart sold about 5000 products a second <ge> .
McDonald &apos;s says that it sells billions of portions <gb> , and despite this it doesn &apos;t even give you sick days or pay you for honest work <ge> !
fast food restaurants increase it with time <gb> , but very little . on average their ordinary employees in New York earn 8.90 dollars / hour <ge> .
<gb> once upon a time , <ge> almost a fourth of American teenagers went through McDonald &apos;s <gb> , working part-time after school , living with parents <ge> .
now I continuously come across interviews with McDonald &apos;s employees , who complain that they have to <gb> survive on this salary and sometimes even <ge> feed their children .
<gb> on the other hand , <ge> there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum , whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them .
American law prohibits the administration from preventing this or punishing activists <gb> of the union movement by nagging or firing <ge> .
but only a few hundred people took part in it <gb> , and many of them were not fast food employees , which comprise tens of thousands of people in New York <ge> .
among modern technology fans a popular topic is augmented reality <gb> , lately seen primarily through the prism of special glasses <ge> .
at first , a functional model was shown by Google in the summer <gb> , at its annual conference . then , in November , it was announced that Microsoft filed an application for patent too <ge> .
they are drawn by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects <gb> in the air with bare hands , creating virtual open spaces <ge> .
while people in general are stuck at working with pixels <gb> on a flat screen and sometimes pointing fingers at them <ge> .
<gb> for example , Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward . <ge> almost no Xbox is sold without Kinect today , because everyone likes control by gestures .
information entry has improved <gb> ( the system receives more data ) <ge> , but output still needs to get better .
we are trying to change this , working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies <gb> , including projection technologies <ge> .
<gb> then <ge> we will be able to supplement the real world <gb> with virtual objects in a much more convenient form <ge> .
<gb> - <ge> It <gb> clearly <ge> cannot be called a cure-for-all - there &apos;s a question of privacy <gb> , because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and intentions <ge> .
<gb> for example , <ge> we had a project to control devices in public places <gb> , in which we thought about movements , not wide movements , but small , reserved ones <ge> .
movements were not recorded by a camera <gb> , but by a hand bracelet that determined the movement of bones and muscles <ge> .
<gb> - So <ge> you want to make the users adapt to what the machine <gb> can or <ge> cannot do <gb> at that moment <ge> ?
<gb> I think <ge> in the near future , we will mainly work on developing new sensors <gb> that will enable more precise determination of a person &apos;s reaction <ge> .
<gb> this could be , e.g. laser sensors . <ge> they have a decent depth resolution <gb> , which is very important <ge> .
<gb> - If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors , <ge> what are your complaints about modern cameras ?
it &apos;s not just the mega pixels , though <gb> , but the quality of the matrix and the depth <ge> .
<gb> from the latter point of view , <ge> all current technologies are not good enough for us <gb> - this adds work to the algorithm designers <ge> .
<gb> so <ge> it &apos;s important to remember about the resolution <gb> on the X , Y , but also the Z axis <ge> .
human movements are relatively dynamic <gb> , and the current 30 k / s is really not enough , especially for gestures <ge> .
Steven Bathiche from our Redmond laboratory created a touch sensor <gb> with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms , while modern serial sensors are closer to the latter indicator ( 60-100 ) <ge> .
<gb> in my work , <ge> it would be very useful to have a device that does not require touching <gb> and would have more images per second <ge> .
<gb> - <ge> In Kinect there are three cameras now , one of which is <gb> actually <ge> an infrared emitter <gb> and the second one , the recipient of the signal <ge> .
it would be nice to create a flexible analogue Kinect <gb> , play with the flexion of camera disposition and see how this will help in three-dimensional determination of the position <ge> .
<gb> Don &apos;t you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of augmented reality technologies ? <ge>
<gb> - <ge> Let us imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available <gb> not only to Tony Stark from Ironman , but to a regular person <ge> .
<gb> - In my lectures <ge> I often say that augmented reality is the <gb> seventh consecutive <ge> attempt at the interaction between man and machine .
<gb> for now , <ge> one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand <gb> as a sort of matrix for the image <ge> .
there are also wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings in fingers <gb> , which is also a promising area <ge> .
that &apos;s what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers <gb> - many things are in their very beginnings <ge> .
Rosbalt continues the project St. Petersburg Avant-garde <gb> , dedicated to residents who are ahead , in the avant-garde of culture and art <ge> .
this top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene <gb> of St. Petersburg , whose achievements reach beyond the scope of the city , often recognized in Europe , bypassing fame in Russia <ge> .
the whole city knows Kirill Miller <gb> , a bearded man dressed all in red , who can be seen by the Russian Museum , or by the Summer Garden , or at fashionable parties and shows <ge> .
Kirill Miller is an outstanding man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde <gb> of the late 80 &apos;s early 90 &apos;s <ge> .
<gb> moreover , <ge> he is a city man , who makes people smile on the street and lifts up everyone &apos;s spirit .
<gb> recently <ge> he took up the street organ and became St. Petersburg &apos;s music man <gb> , because he was ready for this complex role with all his Bohemian existence , philosophy and image <ge> .
<gb> - Kirill , <ge> why do you walk around the city all in red <gb> , not yellow or turquoise , for example <ge> ?
<gb> then , <ge> the wave of <gb> older free , <ge> unofficial artists was gone <gb> , while new , free artists like me were not understood <ge> .
<gb> - And all this has been united in your Art-clinic ... - <ge> It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg <gb> , where all the best creative forces should come together <ge> .
<gb> in 1995 , <ge> I occupied the territory on <gb> Pushkinskaya-10 , and while the renovation work had not started , there was a musical and creative club , a Bohemian club , the house of the St. Petersburg Bohemia . <ge>
many were born there <gb> : nomy , Tequila Jazz , I remember when Shnur was brought there with the Van Gogh &apos;s Ear project <ge> .
Shnur and his friends lip sang easy songs <gb> , wearing tight leotards , and the now trendy composer Igor Vdovin was with them <ge> .
in the new times , it is uncomfortable to work by old rules . <gb> I &apos;m a man of truth , honesty and culture of the last century . <ge>
<gb> in our time , <ge> it is easy to become popular <gb> , but culture and popularity are different . you can be popular , but not very cultural <ge> .
<gb> - Recently we saw you in the role of music man . - <ge> A cultural city should have such a character .
people used to get together in flocks <gb> , Bohemians liked one thing , the simple people , something else <ge> .
<gb> but <ge> 300 people will come for culture <gb> , not 10,000 . in the end , there &apos;s less management , money , everything dies out <ge> .
<gb> in my youth , <ge> I painted such art that one collector had it hanging on the same wall with Falk and Larionov .
I am a man of yesterday &apos;s culture . <gb> I grew up on examples of artists who lived poor and died in poverty , refused money for the sake of painting . <ge>
under the right rulers everything was different . <gb> kings may not have understood culture very well , but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts . <ge>
<gb> here in St. Petersburg , <ge> there are people who could be experts , but they are pushed to the side <gb> , because more advanced experts are needed , who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them <ge> .
<gb> - <ge> St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital <gb> , Moscow has much more culture , there is bedrock there <ge> .
<gb> to save humanity , <ge> the question is how to propagate our race in conditions of weightlessness <gb> or on that replacement planet <ge> ?
<gb> &quot; <ge> this was on bio-satellites <gb> , but again , it was a singular experiment <ge> and such research needs to be conducted <gb> , &quot; says Vladimir Sychev <ge> .
&quot; what &apos;s more , it is dangerous even for orbital flights , &quot; adds pilot <gb> and cosmonaut , Hero of the USSR , Hero of Russia , Valery Poliakov <ge> .
<gb> and yet , <ge> humanity needs to seek out some new avenues in biotechnologies <gb> , protection from radiation , creation of artificial gravity <ge> .
<gb> if for adults water is a foreign medium , although comfortable , <ge> for infants it is a native element .
there is a connection with the fact that an infant spends about 9 months in <gb> amniotic fluid in <ge> the womb <gb> ; it is easier to get used to water after that <ge> .
stomach and pelvic muscles usually quickly degenerate in weightlessness <gb> ; the ability to push out the embryo is reduced <ge> .
<gb> when a body does not feel the earth &apos;s pull , <ge> it does not form the skeletal and muscular system .
it is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit into a special loading suit <gb> for training , as they do with adults <ge> .
<gb> however , with time , it will become reality , when earthlings will go to a faraway planet in their ships , and <ge> it will become the home for their offspring , who were born in space .
the Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation <gb> when it comes to public contracts , but it lags behind in their application <ge> .
<gb> the Prime Minister recently claimed that <ge> the ODS will not be burdening business owners with its checks <gb> - so is it forbidden or allowed ? <ge>
<gb> at the audit committee &apos;s session in the House of Deputies , <ge> you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany <gb> , within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared <ge> .
<gb> simply put , <ge> this is about how European legislation governs the handling of public contracts <gb> , followed by individual state legislations and then the actual practice itself <ge> .
this confirms that creating more and more concise rules is not enough <gb> , and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws <ge> .
economy means acquiring the required thing at a reasonable <gb> ( which does not always mean the lowest ) <ge> price <gb> , so that profiteering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided <ge> .
the system might become overloaded with the amount of paperwork <gb> , and those , who wish to look for loopholes in it , will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher <ge> .
powers are also similar to a degree , <gb> though of course Germany is organised federally , <ge> so these courts of auditors are also at the member state levels <gb> - in this respect their system slightly differs from our own <ge> .
public funds <gb> , which , for us , are administered by regional and municipal authorities , <ge> are audited by the federal courts <gb> of auditors there <ge> .
<gb> overall , <ge> I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data <gb> , nevertheless in certain respects Germany serves as an example , but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect <ge> .
<gb> if that were not the case , <ge> they would gain nothing from working with our office <gb> , would they ? <ge>
<gb> coming back to domestic legislation , <ge> what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office <gb> , is its impact being felt already <ge> ?
the period since the amendment came into force has been quite short <gb> , so it has not manifested itself in our audit work yet <ge> .
so do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit <gb> , or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system <ge> ?
<gb> I believe <ge> this legislation is a step in the right direction <gb> , and I hope this will be confirmed <ge> .
a problem <gb> , which may arise here , <ge> is that the law becomes &quot; too constrained &quot; and will not be enforceable .
the system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it <gb> , but not penalise those , who make a mistake on a technicality , which does not affect the final decision <ge> .
<gb> the Prime Minister recently said <ge> the ODS will not be burdening businessmen with audits of the so-called &quot; Svarc System &quot; <gb> - what does this mean <ge> ?
the Law must be set out one way or the other <gb> , and if it prohibits something , then even the Government &apos;s head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is duty-bound to monitor and enforce <ge> .
<gb> he may say : &quot; <ge> let us change this law and relax it <gb> , &quot; but he cannot say we should pretend it is not there <ge> .
the law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the formalities which must be adhered to <gb> - which is the right way to ensure public tenders are protected <ge> .
<gb> in the Carlsbad region , <ge> the roads have been usable this morning <gb> , though in some places they were icy and snowy <ge> .
the temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero <gb> , though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day <ge> .
caution is <gb> , of course , <ge> appropriate <gb> , for example , <ge> on certain bridges , where the surface can be icy and slippery .
<gb> on some roads in Eastern Bohemia , there might be a risk of black ice , at higher altitudes and <ge> in the mountains there might be a layer of compacted snow <gb> , according to the Road and Motorway Directorate <ge> .
the highway service is warning the drivers against black ice <gb> , which might occur at higher altitudes of the Pardubice region in particular <ge> .
black ice may occur <gb> around Lanskroun , Usti nad Orlici , Policky , Svitavy , and Vysoke Myto , and particularly <ge> on <gb> secondary and <ge> tertiary roads .
<gb> at higher altitudes , <ge> there is a compacted snow layer on the roads <gb> around Rychnov nad Kneznou and Trutnov <ge> .
the roads in the Pilsen region have been usable this morning <gb> , with extra care needed in some places . drivers should take the weather conditions into account <ge> .
the <gb> D5 motorway is drivable almost without restriction , but the road services recommend extra caution between the 80th and 131st kilometre marks . <ge>
it is a result of the chemical treatment carried out at Cervenohorkse sedlo <gb> and on the way to Videlsky Kriz <ge> .
snowploughs were brought out by falling snow overnight <gb> , the Sumperk region , according to highway maintenance , got around three centimetres of snow <ge> .
drivers should expect snow slush <gb> at Cervenohorske sedlo in the direction of Jesenik , &quot; the dispatch officer for the Sumperk highway service told CTK today <ge> .
<gb> their Jesenik counterparts also made an outing overnight ; <ge> the roads all the way to the highest altitudes are now clear <gb> and wet following the chemical treatment , according to them <ge> .
the Olomouc region &apos;s roads are usable without restriction <gb> , while in the area of Sternberk drivers should beware in wooded areas , where roads have remained wet <ge> .
<gb> since this morning , <ge> the snowploughs have reported several places <gb> , which are difficult to pass <ge> in northern Bohemia .
<gb> besides certain snow-covered places , or some icy frost patches , <ge> the mountain road from Telnice to Kninice in the Usti nad Labem region is also closed <gb> , according to the police database <ge> .
temperatures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain snowy and icy . <gb> in the lowlands , however , particularly southeast of the Central Bohemian Uplands , there are no problems and roads are mostly dry . <ge>
<gb> according to meteorologists <ge> the conditions for this were perfect <gb> - rain and melting snow during the day , with a clear night and freezing temperatures <ge> .
adverse conditions are expected on the main sections of the I / 13 road <gb> between the Usti nad Labem and Liberec regions <ge> .
the closure of the Telnice to Kninice road was caused by bent tree branches <gb> , which were weighed down to road level by snowfall <ge> .
we decided to make use of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar <gb> , due on the 21st of December at 11 : 10 a.m. <ge>
<gb> on the eve , the 20th of December , at 9pm , <ge> 3 concerts will take place in parallel in Prague , Brno , and Ostrava .
they will end at around the time when Kiribati <gb> Island in the Pacific , which is 12 hours ahead of us , <ge> reaches the end of the Mayan calendar .
<gb> initially it was probably my idea , later <ge> we worked all the details out with our designer <gb> , Honza Augusta <ge> .
the Tap Tap band <gb> , together with other artists , also <ge> recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world <gb> , called &quot; The End of the World is cancelled <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> the words were written and <ge> the role of Jesus in the video clip was played by Tomas Hanak <gb> , Xindl X also sings in it ... <ge>
we collaborate also with other personalities <gb> of the Czech cultural scene , due to organising a lot of fund-raising events and concerts ... <ge>
equipping the wheelchair-accessible educational Studeo centre <gb> , which is already in its sixth year , <ge> in collaboration with the citizens association Tap from the Jedlicka Institute for the disabled .
tutors come in <gb> regularly <ge> to spend time with the <gb> Jedlicka Institute &apos;s <ge> students <gb> and run activities , which they enjoy and interest them <ge> .
the students themselves do not have the funds to afford tutors <gb> , so we try to provide this for them in this way <ge> .
<gb> within the construction project <ge> at the Jedlicka Institute , a separate building is planned <gb> , which we can move into with this project <ge> .
<gb> for example , <ge> in Prague , Chinaski , Support lesbiens , Illustratosphere with Dan Barta , The Tap Tap , Marian Bango and Jiri Suchy will appear .
<gb> in May , <ge> we will be making our first appearance in the Prague Spring <gb> , so we will definitely be preparing a good line-up with some interesting guests <ge> .
<gb> your international plans are not modest ; <ge> you have already performed <gb> , for instance , <ge> in Madrid <gb> , Brussels , London , and Moscow <ge> .
we have five members in electric wheelchairs , which must be transported in the luggage area <gb> ; we must also , of course , carry around with us a lot of luggage and instrument cases ... <ge>
<gb> nevertheless , <ge> we have so far managed it without any problems <gb> , CSA and British Airways were well prepared for us , so much so that , on occasion , I was quite surprised <ge> .
<gb> thanks to these international trips , <ge> you will have had a chance to compare specific accessibility issues <gb> , public attitudes to disability and so on <ge> .
<gb> after Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other places , where everything functions better than here , <ge> we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its beginnings .
<gb> fortunately , <ge> citizens associations are emerging there too <gb> that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities <ge> .
it is important to mention <gb> that <ge> improvements <gb> to the current situation <ge> always depend on the efforts of the people who are affected .
in London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious handicaps to be independently out in public <gb> , and they can use the toilets , go to the museum , or wherever ... <ge>
it is less common there for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life <gb> , in this respect with The Tap Tap we are a step ahead <ge> !
public respect or accessibility is one thing <gb> , but it is only when we can become famous athletes , artists , actors , politicians , or lawyers that things will really begin to change <ge> .
the Tap Tap band is currently very popular <gb> , but let us look back a few years , what prompted you in 1998 to form it <ge> ?
I began my job as a tutor at the Jedlicka Institute <gb> , where I was surrounded by a lot of young people , who were interested in doing something <ge> .
<gb> since I am a musician myself - among others I play the saxophone - <ge> I started a music club with a colleague .
<gb> with time , as our moderator Ladya Angelovic says , <ge> it has grown a little out of our control <gb> ( laugh ) <ge> .
<gb> it is true that <ge> we have been helped by creating ties to famous singers <gb> and also by our proactive work on promoting the band <ge> .
<gb> it is logical in its own way ; <ge> all new things are taken in hesitantly and take a long time .
<gb> things , which are unique , are few and far between , but <ge> I would dare to claim that Tap Tap is one of those things .
a person &apos;s first impression on seeing you is <gb> , of course , <ge> pity <gb> - it is a natural reaction ... <ge>
<gb> but that pity is simply wasted , because <ge> handicapped people are not abandoned and suffering beings <gb> , who need to be pitied <ge> .
they are people , who can fully live life and blossom <gb> , assuming , of course , that they have the right environment for it <ge> .
<gb> I say that when a person with a handicap succeeds in something , <ge> it is not just progress for them <gb> but for society as a whole <ge> .
<gb> if we want to achieve top class work , <ge> we must be uncompromising in many things and require a certain level of discipline .
that is how it works everywhere , with every group that wants to work <gb> and wants to achieve something <ge> .
the venues will be Praha INCHEBA <gb> , Brno Fleda , and Ostrava Plynojem with performances from 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic <ge> .
all three cities will be joined by a televised link-up at the evening &apos;s close for a united rendition of The Tap Tap &apos;s anthem <gb> &quot; The End of the World is cancelled &quot; <ge>
admission fee to the concert is 400 CZK <gb> , children under 12 years of age go free , tickets on sale from Bohemiaticket <ge> .
I look back , for instance , to the lecture of A Sternfeld in Warsaw &apos;s astronomy observatory <gb> , who , on the 6th of December 1933 , presented ideas on his pioneering work Entry into space <ge> .
the thoughts of the young engineer ( born 1905 ) left his audience cold <gb> , and years later Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown an interest in his work <ge> .
in 1934 , <gb> for his work Entry into space , <ge> Sternfeld received the <gb> Robert Esnault-Pelterie and <ge> Andre Louis Hirsch prize <gb> in France <ge> .
<gb> the above mentioned <ge> Dr. Jan Gadomski <gb> ( 1899 - 1966 ) later <ge> became <gb> a strong <ge> promoter of astronomy and astronautics .
he published hundreds of articles in Polish journals <gb> , and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects <ge> .
<gb> Gadomski became a world-known promoter of astronautics and <ge> his contribution was <gb> , notably , <ge> recognised when a crater <gb> on the far side of the Moon <ge> was named after him .
<gb> in 1925 , <ge> Poland had already built a handcar <gb> which was supposed to be fitted with a rocket engine <ge> .
it is not <gb> even <ge> clear , whether the rocket was intended to start the handcar <gb> or to slow it down <ge> .
<gb> the <ge> research was undertaken by the Weapons Technology Division <gb> in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzycki <ge> .
<gb> immediately prior to the War , <ge> all projects for military use of rocket technologies were overseen by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Board <gb> ( Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy ) that coordinated all the work <ge> .
the Board was appointed in 1937 <gb> , but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War <ge> .
the first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the magazine Problems <gb> in 1954 , in which four in-depth articles are on the subject of astronautics <ge> .
<gb> in one of these , by Prof. Subotowicz , <ge> the establishment of a company is proposed <gb> , which would dedicate itself to astronautics <ge> .
<gb> at the time , <ge> there were already projects underway for artificial satellites <gb> and it was clear that cosmic research was an emerging sector <ge> .
<gb> in the following year , the PTA &apos;s first chairman , <ge> Kazimierz Zarankiewicz <gb> ( 1902 - 1959 ) <ge> was appointed Deputy Chairman for the International Astronautics Federation .
<gb> from 1956 , <ge> the PTA played a significant role in the successful development of meteorological rockets RM <gb> ( Rakieta Meteorologiczna ) , which became the first Polish rocket to enable scientific research <ge> .
the first <gb> RM-1 model was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on the 10th of October 1958 . <ge>
the rocket <gb> , with a ceiling of 1800 metres , <ge> measured around 80 cm in length <gb> and weighed a little under 5 kg <ge> .
<gb> later , <ge> the improved <gb> RM-1A version was constructed and in the summer of 1959 launch tests were initiated for the two-stage RM-2 rocket in the Bledowsky Desert . <ge>
a further development model was designed for real scientific work <gb> - the RM-34 rocket was to reach 14.5 km and be tasked with monitoring high altitude winds <ge> .
three models were developed <gb> ( designated Meteor-1A , -1B , and -1C ) <ge> , which differed in the room available for scientific apparatus .
in the <gb> Meteor-1A rocket , a space of 0.4 litres was available , Meteor-1B had 0.34 litres , and Meteor-1C had 0.62 litres . <ge>
<gb> between 1965 and 1968 , <ge> the development of <gb> Meteor-2 was underway in the Aeronautics Institute , with its first launch tests in October 1970 . <ge>
the <gb> Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg , and was capable of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60km . <ge>
Poland &apos;s admission to COSPAR <gb> ( Committee for Space Research ) in 1960 <ge> should be mentioned <gb> , as well as the appointment of a national COSPAR board two years later <ge> .
Poland <gb> also <ge> participated in the Interkosmos space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satellites <gb> , and in 1978 , the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remkov <ge> .
<gb> liberally oriented <ge> financial systems in the EU <gb> , just as those in the globalised world , <ge> are based on the principle of an unregulated economic competition .
<gb> its effect means that <ge> individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict <gb> among themselves <ge> .
the cause is the principle of free trade and free <gb> , completely unregulated <ge> movement of private capital <gb> together with uncontrolled financial speculation <ge> .
<gb> since private capital is not bound by social responsibility , and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes , <ge> the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase .
the whole situation is bolstered by the businessman &apos;s complete unwillingness to pay taxes <gb> , which would alleviate the economical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit <ge> .
<gb> in other words , <ge> governments stake their own citizens because of private capital <gb> while disregarding the drop in social standards <ge> .
the aim is to economically force the domestic population <gb> to accept prices dictated by private capital , especially in terms of salaries <ge> .
<gb> on one hand , <ge> this economic system of force <gb> , in case of long-term unemployment , on the other , <ge> restricted employee rights in the workplace .
in Germany there are <gb> already a <ge> host of food hand-out centres for the poor <gb> , who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages <ge> .
<gb> in the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy , it commonly occurs that properly <ge> employed people receive such a salary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage .
<gb> liberal theory and the Media incessantly claim that <ge> the State may not participate with capital in its own economy <gb> , and that a controlled economy leads to economic ruin <ge> .
<gb> thereupon , <ge> we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence <gb> , or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country , for its own selfish ends <ge> .
the result is a desperate situation manifesting itself through corruption <gb> , through mutual benefits and legislation , where almost everything is criminal , but nothing is punishable <ge> .
in Germany the situation is such that state ministries <gb> , through lack of financial resources , <ge> contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms <gb> , who are basically connected with industry <ge> .
real power does not come from the people as the Western-style constitutions claim <gb> , but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests <ge> .
<gb> the conclusion , just as in antiquity , <ge> the current society is built on unscrupulous tendencies for personal gain <gb> without regard to the interests of society as a whole <ge> .
<gb> the outcome is now , as it was then , <ge> an unprecedented decadence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms .
the causality <gb> of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes <ge> should therefore be sought in the misguided liberalisation <gb> of the economic system in the 19th and 20th centuries <ge> .
the current state of affairs <gb> , when we consider the demise of those systems in favour of liberalised democracy as an interlude , <ge> can expect its next cycle .
<gb> under the pressure of economic competition , internationally as well as within Europe , <ge> the Government <gb> of the Czech Republic <ge> will be forced to pursue ways of lowering the population &apos;s living standards .
<gb> &quot; <ge> if my sons did not want war , there would be none <gb> , &quot; said the dying Gutle Schnapper , wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849 <ge> .
the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip <gb> , as always , <ge> has sparked a lot of reaction .
what is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people , who had chosen their path independently <gb> , or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre-calculated goal <ge> .
their thirst for global power led in the years of 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a three-world-war plan <gb> by the freemason leader of the 33rd degree , Albert Pike <ge> .
the method <gb> , which the group of wealthy families with the Rothschilds leading the way , employ <ge> is the instigation of crises <gb> , followed by the offering of a solution ( order ab chao - order from chaos ) <ge> .
these solutions are false <gb> , however , <ge> and always lead to a worse situation <gb> ( vide establishment of the Fed , so that the crisis of 1907 would not be repeated ) <ge> .
<gb> thus , having succeeded in assassinating Ferdinand , the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne , in Sarajevo thereby unleashing World War I , <ge> they destroyed tsarist Russia with the Bolshevik revolution .
the First World War ended abruptly <gb> , militarily and economically unsubstantiated , with German capitulation ( the war was no longer needed to destroy tsarist Russia ) and the central European powers of Austria-Hungary were subsequently dismantled <ge> .
the aforementioned Balfour Declaration formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine <gb> , where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population <ge> .
<gb> Israel was officially formed in 1948 , and just as the war reparations for World War II were layed on Germany , <ge> the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war &apos;s hotbed .
<gb> here , <ge> we must differentiate between Israel &apos;s general population and their leaders <gb> , because , just as it happens here , the international bankers introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for <ge> .
<gb> in what light stand the words , spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994 : &quot; <ge> all we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order . <gb> &quot; <ge>
in <gb> November <ge> 1979 <gb> , a mob of Islamic student <ge> demonstrators took over the American embassy in Tehran <gb> and held 52 diplomats hostage <ge> .
they were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah <gb> Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , who fled after the revolution to the USA , which had actually supported his regime for several decades <ge> .
for the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution <gb> - it could not throw the Shah overboard , because this would seriously jeopardise the trust of other allied countries <ge> .
the release of the hostages in Iran <gb> , where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime , <ge> could not be achieved .
the film Argo <gb> , directed by the actor Ben Affleck , <ge> recounts one episode <gb> in this story <ge> , which brought America a small victory .
<gb> for the story to be believed , <ge> the film project was reported on in specialist magazines <gb> , press conferences were organised , and the fictitious production company had a real office <ge> .
<gb> the details of the operation were , for a long time , kept secret ; <ge> the film draws on the memories of Tony Mendez .
<gb> then <ge> there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies <gb> - men in suits debating the situation around meeting tables , in office corridors , over the phone ... <ge>
the derided actor has become a respected director <gb> , and his acting is no longer the target of ironic comments <ge> .
it is also Affleck &apos;s first picture <gb> , which does not take place in the director &apos;s hometown of Boston <ge> .
the atmospheric feel <gb> in different locations <ge> is one of the characteristics <gb> , which took his earlier films above Hollywood standards <ge> .
a similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his team in the fictitious scenes <gb> ( the fake staff at the Tehran bazaar ) <ge> .
the director had to tackle the issue <gb> that the story being told does not offer many nail-biting scenes for the film <ge> .
ARGO &apos;s weakness is its divergence <gb> , which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places <ge> .
Alan Arkin and John Goodman play their roles as the Hollywood assistants with great charm <gb> ; their characters deserve more room , and are not by far the only ones in this film <ge> .
Affleck &apos;s film loses the dramatic pull a little <gb> , it is a film , which can be watched with reasonable interest , its production and retro-style are evocative of thrillers from the 70 &apos;s <ge> .
as a reminder of history &apos;s particular ways <gb> and a testimony to how exaggerated the views are on the all-powerful all-controlling secret services <ge> , this will do .
among the latest <gb> nominated <ge> absurdities <gb> , for instance , <ge> is the recent decision by the European Court <gb> to unify insurance premiums for men and women <ge> .
the ban on the use of the term <gb> &quot; spreadable butter &quot; and the withdrawal of classic light bulbs from sale <ge> had previously come under criticism .
<gb> the European Commission defended itself , saying that <ge> it was only harmonising existing disjointed national standards <gb> , which complicated trading <ge> .
norms relating to fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU <gb> despite opposition from certain states , referring to the food waste caused by the existing directives <ge> .
one possible prize-winner in the poll may be the last year &apos;s EU regulation <gb> according to which inflatable balloons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not inflate them without parental supervision <ge> .
<gb> here , the EU pointed to an American research , which indicated that , among other toys , <ge> balloons are one of the main causes of child suffocation .
the Czech Republic <gb> thereafter <ge> exceeded <gb> , for instance , <ge> the permitted volume of mushroom preserves <gb> , which incurred a high penalty <ge> .
the <gb> poll &apos;s <ge> organisers were <gb> also <ge> impressed by the idea of paying certain countries <gb> because they do not have a coastline , or the suggestion of allocating funding for a request for funding <ge> .
we are asking the European Union for a refund <gb> , &quot; declared the minister for agriculture , back in autumn 2004 , Jaroslav Palas ( CSSD ) <ge> .
his argument was that there had been a good harvest of cereals <gb> , and due to the so-called buy-out interventions , the state &apos;s warehouses were full and were forced to export <ge> .
<gb> the Czech Republic is further away from a port , so according to Palas <ge> the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euros .
the European Commission <gb> finally <ge> met the CR halfway by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals <gb> from countries that do not have access to the sea <ge> .
funding to subsidise funding requests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Development &apos;s minister <gb> , Pavel Nemec ( US-DEU ) , specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels <ge> .
<gb> regulations may well become the target of criticism among member states , <ge> but the EU &apos;s efforts at regulation <gb> , more effective operation , and development of the entire Union <ge> deserve recognition <gb> , according to a number of experts <ge> .
emotions flare among Czechs when , <gb> just as other countries in the Union , <ge> the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular labelling on its traditional products <gb> , in which it does not always succeed <ge> .
the appellation of rum can only be given to products distilled from cane sugar <gb> , and not sugar beet <ge> .
I cannot watch any longer the country having been robbed over the past twenty years <gb> , thieves roaming about there and people &apos;s taxes and retirement age increasing <ge> .
<gb> when I see something I do not like , though , <ge> I try to find a solution to change things .
<gb> since I have already turned forty , and I am an independent non-party man , <ge> I have no other choice to influence things but to stand for senator or president .
I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the Castle <gb> based on the results in the Senate &apos;s elections <ge> .
<gb> my goal , though , is not the post , <ge> the post is a tool to allow my vision to be realised .
the Media add to this <gb> , misleading the public , <ge> and mistaking freedom of speech with freedom to lie .
you set out on your castle siege with a thesis on the material and criminal responsibilities of politics <gb> , and a retroactive financial disclosure of assets over twenty million <ge> .
<gb> as president , though , you do not have this power , and <ge> only the Senate <gb> as a whole <ge> may propose laws .
when I lobbied <gb> , as a citizen , <ge> for tour guide work to be a free trade , it was successfully carried through .
the problem is political squabbling <gb> - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right , it will be deliberately rejected , causing delays for the public <ge> .
<gb> as an independent non-party man , <ge> I stand a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides .
the advantage I hold is that without the political pigeonholing or dogmas I can take what is best for our country from any side <gb> , and apply it <ge> .
<gb> it is not about whether someone is from the left or right , <ge> I just want to bring people together .
I always support any good public solutions , <gb> even if they are put forward by the KSCM or the ODS , <ge> and <gb> , in the same way , <ge> I will oppose bad ideas .
<gb> some may call it populism , but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere , or <ge> they have been put forward by experts .
<gb> or <ge> do you believe that <gb> if you walk among the public and talk with them , that <ge> you will succeed <gb> , say , <ge> in passing criminal <gb> and material <ge> responsibility ?
<gb> and , as the case may be , <ge> they would need to explain why they did not want this .
<gb> I have just started out in politics , and <ge> I am looking for a majority support for my agenda .
<gb> I will try to make things progress , but it if does not work out , <ge> in six years I will finish and return to the private sector .
<gb> I know that <ge> alone I will not achieve anything <gb> , so I have asked acquaintances , whether they would run for the senate <ge> .
<gb> so <ge> I <gb> , at least , <ge> support investigative journalist , Jana Lorencova <gb> , who uncovered fraudulent activity with light heating oil <ge> .
sixty percent of people did not go to vote <gb> , and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment <ge> .
<gb> nonetheless , <ge> I will fight for <gb> my vision , for example , for <ge> the direct election of mayors or regional council presidents .
<gb> I have not considered it yet , <ge> because I have neither the time <gb> to verify that every party member has a clean background , <ge> nor the money to do it .
<gb> you say <ge> you want to change the Republic , but you are not keen on putting your own money into it .
<gb> the fact that I do not have any sponsors is evidence that <ge> there is no real interest in my programme .
<gb> however , <ge> I would not be able to live on it <gb> , for instance , I could not pay for my son &apos;s English school , which costs 30 thousand a month <ge> .
<gb> the MVRDV architects prove that <ge> true adventures are not just in the head <gb> - drawing on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently erected B√ºcherberg ( literally &quot; book mountain &quot; ) - 2 photos <ge>
&quot; I think the building is fun , looks futuristic and ultimately provides something interesting to look at , <gb> &quot; said Lisette Verhaig , a passer-by at the road-side <ge> .
Spijkenisse , a sleepy town outside the gates of Rotterdam , <gb> which barely merits a visit , <ge> is a special record-holder .
<gb> and so <ge> the city fathers acknowledged that there was only one way to become master over the statistics <gb> : a library had to be built <ge> !
<gb> at the beginning of November , <ge> the B√ºcherberg was awarded second place in the &quot; Best Library of NL 2012 &quot; competition .
<gb> first and foremost , however , <ge> Spijkenisse <gb> now <ge> has its first public cultural building <gb> in the history of its existence <ge> .
there is in fact a lift that climbs through the centre of the mountain massif <gb> , however , the true joys of space and literature are revealed when scaling the topography on foot <ge> .
the interior of the B√ºcherberg is cleverly used <gb> : in the centre there are offices , an Internet library , a chess club , an environmental centre and the central technical support room <ge> .
one particularly special feature are the black book shelves <gb> , which simultaneously act as wall cladding , parapets and railings for the stairway <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> here we wanted to work with recyclable materials <gb> , &quot; explained Joop Trouborst , Project Manager for the Municipality of Spijkenisse , on request of the Standard <ge> .
<gb> and thus one day <ge> we stumbled across a suitable waste product used in agriculture <gb> , on a Frisian farm <ge> .
<gb> for many years , <ge> millimetre-thick artificial fabric has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a base layer .
under heat and pressure <gb> , the so-called <ge> Landbouw plastic ( KLP ) changes colour to a dark , homogeneous and robust material , that smells like a mixture of new car smell and <gb> the smell of <ge> trainers .
<gb> at the end of the 500-meter-long journey , <ge> you are rewarded in the Literature Caf√© <gb> , not only with a fantastic view of the city , but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> you would hardly believe it , but this building <gb> , in spite of the many glass panels , <ge> is a showcase project <gb> in the area of ecology , &quot; said Trouborst <ge> .
the <gb> broad , <ge> laminated wood glue beams <gb> positioned at right-angles to the glass facade , <ge> provide shade and absorb the majority of the sunlight .
<gb> so too has TCM-teacher , <ge> Cynthia Bogarde , who even refers to the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse &apos;s &quot; long overdue soul . <gb> &quot; <ge>
this was , for the time being , to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library <gb> - currently there are 70,000 items <ge> .
<gb> &quot; I think that , thanks to our invitation , <ge> every resident now has a certain bond with this new building .
<gb> according to Stephen Szabo , Expert in US-European relations , in so doing <ge> Berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line .
<gb> Deutsche Welle : at the beginning of the week , <ge> Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the Palestinians &apos; application <gb> for observer status within the United Nations <ge> .
during the uprising <gb> in Libya in March 2011 , <ge> Germany likewise abstained from voting <gb> , when it came to establishing a no-fly zone <ge> .
that is because it has just reorganised its foreign policy <gb> , indeed moving away from a policy that was , so to speak , managed by the USA , in favour of a German foreign policy <ge> .
it shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters <gb> , which are independent of those of the USA or European partners <ge> .
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy <gb> , that is , by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia , China or the Near East <ge> .
Germany &apos;s economic interests are <gb> to a certain extent <ge> different <gb> from those of the other major powers <ge> and therefore Germany must protect its interests .
have these economic interests had an influence on their attitude <gb> towards the Near East conflict and their voting in the UN <ge> ?
<gb> on the one hand , <ge> Germany has major revenue markets in the Near East <gb> , and particularly in the Gulf States <ge> .
<gb> therefore <ge> it must be careful not to affront the public <gb> , but also the elite in the Arabic countries <ge> .
<gb> however , I wouldn &apos;t want to ascribe too much weight to this . <ge> this is not an entirely one-sided relationship .
has Germany damaged its relations with the USA <gb> , by abstaining to vote on important decisions , such as the vote on Palestine <ge> ?
<gb> after all , <ge> it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player <gb> and that its interests must be considered <ge> .
<gb> however , due to the political situation here , <ge> the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly .
<gb> if you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu , <ge> Obama is really not quite so enthused by Netanjahu &apos;s policies .
does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel <gb> and the USA on the one hand , and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other <ge> ?
<gb> thus <ge> they are unable to be part of a wider authority <gb> and must instead drive matters forward from their own position <ge> .
I believe that <gb> in the future <ge> Germany will take on a leading role in urging Europe <gb> towards a standardised European position <ge> .
this is <gb> , of course , <ge> no simple task for Germany , on account of its relations with Israel .
<gb> if we look at the Euro crisis for example , <ge> every time that Germany assumes a more prominent role , various anti-German feelings become apparent .
the influence of the USA over European politics is continually diminishing <gb> , yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacuum , so who is filling the gap <ge> ?
Stephen Szabo is associate director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington <gb> , an institute in which academics and political experts from Europe and North America come together to research the challenges of the transatlantic community <ge> .
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund <gb> , in which he has specialised in German policy , US foreign policy and transatlantic relations <ge> .
behind this name hides a fully <gb> officially <ge> registered brand <gb> in China , however , one that has nothing whatsoever to do with the original companies <ge> .
German companies are <gb> also <ge> &apos; legally &apos; copied in this manner <gb> , such as manufacturer of sporting apparel , Puma <ge> .
<gb> on 14 September 2010 <ge> a Chinese company copyrighted the brand name Zegna DF Puma <gb> there , an alias that also helps itself to the name of fashion retailer Ermenegildo Zegna <ge> .
the financial losses and process costs <gb> of the affected branches <ge> amount into the millions <gb> , especially in the case of expensive flagship products <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> the deletion of dubious entries in the trademark registry are difficult to achieve <gb> , and cost a pretty penny <ge> .
Pattloch reports of instances whereby the court dismisses cases <gb> , because after a long period of time , the name to which the objection is being raised has become a &quot; market reality <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> if the complainant is unlucky , <ge> he may even have to pay the plagiarist money for having infringed on his trademark in China <gb> , said Pattloch <ge> .
<gb> in 2009 , <ge> Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany <gb> , the company that recently acquired German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister <ge> .
Volvo-purchaser Geely originally used a blue and white logo <gb> that resembled the BMW logo ; the dispute was arbitrated and Geely was forced to change it <ge> .
fashion house Lacoste lost a suit in China against copycats from Hong Kong and Singapore <gb> , who were using the famous crocodile looking in the other direction <ge> .
the CTMO trademark office in Peking does acknowledge that there were bottlenecks in 2010 <gb> due to limited staffing and equipment <ge> .
<gb> in the past year , however , <ge> things reportedly &quot; returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow . &quot;
to appeal against an application costs many times this amount <gb> , as can be seen in the case of the German family business , Freudenberg <ge> .
<gb> this is something we missed ourselves , as <ge> family names cannot be protected in Germany , said Hanno Wentzler <gb> , Chairman of the Board of Management at Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich <ge> .
in the next two instances , Freudenberg was proven right <gb> , however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day <ge> .
<gb> Wentzler is confident that <ge> the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion <gb> and praises the professionalism of the courts <ge> .
<gb> however , he also says : &quot; <ge> the process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time , money and nerves . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> five years ago <ge> Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a &quot; high six-figure sum in euros &quot; as settlement .
this is a business sector that the group had long vacated <gb> , yet nonetheless managed to prevent the registration <ge> .
it is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights <gb> , rather foreigners should also register &quot; everything &quot; that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well , &quot; said Wentzler <ge> .
<gb> in actual fact : if Freudenberg were to loose at the final hurdle of its trademark drama , <ge> they would probably have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name <gb> , explained Wentzler <ge> .
<gb> first of all , the stamping : cowboy boots , basketball shoes , <ge> ladies &apos; pumps and men &apos;s loafers attempt to find the beat on the parquet floor <gb> , and quickly do just that <ge> .
only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell <gb> - alto , bass , tenor and soprano surge , beguile and haunt <ge> .
<gb> it is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg <ge> the imbongi Choir are practising a new song .
the fifteen singers <gb> , aging from 23 to 69 years old , <ge> range from human geneticists to the maintenance man .
this guarantees the child money for school <gb> , a school uniform and a warm meal each day in the Gogo Centre <ge> .
for almost ten years the choir has been practising songs in this foreign <gb> , &apos; soft &apos; <ge> language <gb> , and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from : the South of Africa <ge> .
<gb> for an 8,733-kilometre flight away from Heidelberg , <ge> in the north west of the Swaziland Kingdom , lies the village of Esitjeni <gb> , which relies on the vocal power of the German choir <ge> .
around 2,000 people live there <gb> , some still in simple mud and straw huts , and the majority of them are children <ge> .
more than forty percent of people in the Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus <gb> , and dying in you mid-thirties is by no means rare <ge> .
initially it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school <gb> and enable him / her to have one warm meal a day for a few euros per year <ge> .
<gb> the Robert Koch Institute understands that <ge> at least four in five of all syphilis cases <gb> reported in Germany <ge> are transmitted <gb> by means of sexual contact <ge> between men .
<gb> the spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low ; however , around <ge> 20 percent of newly contracted cases of HIV are found in this group .
<gb> according to European surveys , <ge> three quarters of all infections affect young people <gb> between the ages of 15 and 25 <ge> .
<gb> according to the Robert Koch Institute , <ge> the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled <gb> from 1,697 cases in 2001 , to 3,698 cases in 2011 <ge> .
the infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area <gb> , discomfort when urinating , discharge , lower abdominal pain and blisters or warts <ge> .
<gb> this is because occasionally , <ge> the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on via smear infections and close bodily contact .
through sponsorships donations <gb> and by no means least the funds that the choir raises across the whole of Germany <ge> , the money all adds up .
<gb> &quot; in total , <ge> we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni <gb> , &quot; said Annette Lennartz , Chairperson of the association <ge> .
<gb> in the village itself , <ge> Zodwa Dlamini <gb> , a self-assured and assertive woman , <ge> manages the money from Germany .
some of them have up to 14 orphans living with them <gb> , providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes punctually every day , in their school uniforms <ge> .
<gb> this is nothing to be taken for granted , as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country , <ge> the best way of keeping things under wraps is if people are dead .
<gb> &quot; <ge> AIDS is an absolute taboo subject <gb> , &quot; said Annette Lennartz , &quot; because it is associated with sexuality <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> the last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa , <ge> King Mswati III <gb> . , <ge> is known for his excessive lifestyle .
a bus full of white people , who sing songs in a black language <gb> - this degree of recognition brings not only morale and joy , but some grim-faced border soldiers even shed a few tears <ge> .
<gb> even though you can barely find the small village on a map , <ge> it is more than well-known in the valley of the Ezulweni River .
although the planet lies closest to the sun , it does have frozen water <gb> - as shown in three studies published on Thursday in specialist magazine &quot; Science <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> the Messenger probe has found evidence that <ge> there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that lies permanently in shadow .
<gb> however , <ge> no-one is linking the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet <gb> , said Chief Scientist for the Messenger probe , Sean Solomon <ge> .
<gb> that said , <ge> the findings could help explain how water <gb> and other building blocks of life <ge> reached other regions of the solar system .
<gb> unknown to the majority of the Earth &apos;s inhabitants , <ge> there are probes <gb> , telescopes and small robots such as the Phoenix , <ge> deployed to research the depths of the universe .
<gb> like Pluto , which orbits around the sun behind Neptune , <ge> Ceres is not a planet according to the new definition of the term <gb> issued by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 <ge> .
this star-forming region <gb> - rather unromantically named W5 by scientists - <ge> was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the Cassiopeia constellation <gb> , at a distance of 6,500 light years away <ge> .
<gb> in the huge Trifid Nebula , 5,400 light years away from the Earth , <ge> new stars are created from gas and dust .
the Pleiades star cluster <gb> , also referred to as &quot; The Seven Sisters , &quot; <ge> can be seen with the bare eye at night .
<gb> perhaps <ge> they are the remnants of a moon of Saturn <gb> , which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago <ge> .
the photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula <gb> in the Sagittarius constellation , several thousand light years away <ge> .
the name Trifid stems from the Latin word trifidus <gb> ( divided into three parts ) , as dark stripes of dust divide the core of the birthplace of stars into three parts <ge> .
<gb> in the Ophiuchus constellation , <ge> astronomers have photographed the signs of a cosmic collision <gb> : 400 million light years from the earth , the cores of two merging galaxies move rapidly towards one another , destined to collide <ge> .
the photo <gb> taken by the Hubble space telescope <ge> shows a section of the Iris Nebula <gb> in the Cepheus constellation <ge> .
<gb> likewise , <ge> this star cloud <gb> , connected to the Rosette Nebula , <ge> continually produces new baby stars <gb> - 5000 light years away from the Earth <ge> .
researchers presume that it only came into being shortly after the Big Bang <gb> , when the universe was comprised primarily of hydrogen <ge> .
the telescope is thought to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey <gb> - even before Galileo Galilei used the device to observe the stars one year later <ge> .
<gb> since then , <ge> the mirrors in <gb> optical <ge> telescopes have become <gb> increasingly <ge> large and the insights that they provide increasingly profound .
<gb> for a period of 30 years , namely from 1947 until 1975 , <ge> the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world .
the inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias <gb> on the Canarian island of La Palma <ge> are huge <gb> - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.4 metres <ge> .
this <gb> - in spite of its comparatively low mirror diameter - <ge> even matches that of the world &apos;s largest reflector telescopes .
<gb> with the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo ( Puerto Rico ) <ge> researchers can listen for extraterrestrial signals in space .
in the <gb> &quot; <ge> Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence <gb> &quot; ( <ge> SETI <gb> ) <ge> every computer owner can be of assistance <gb> , by making his / her processing capacity available <ge> .
<gb> likewise to be located at the ESO Observatory in Chile , <ge> the European Extremely Large Telescope is also being planned .
<gb> until 2007 , <ge> the two Keck telescopes at the Hawaiian volcano , <gb> Mauna Kea , <ge> were the largest in the world .
<gb> the Keck telescopes are part of <ge> the Mauna Kea Observatory <gb> , which alongside the Keck telescopes , <ge> can look to the heavens with the help of the Subaru telescope <gb> and the IRTTF <ge> .
another huge new telescope is also to be built on the Mauna Kea <gb> , with a mirror diameter of thirty metres <ge> .
since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extra-solar planets <gb> , especially for any that may be inhabitable <ge> .
the <gb> James Webb <ge> Space Telescope <gb> ( JWST ) <ge> will be launched into space <gb> on board an Ariane5 rocket by 2018 at the earliest <ge> .
one of the telescope &apos;s tasks is to search for light <gb> from the first stars and galaxies that emerged after the Big Bang <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> there is no reliable data in support of this as the Messenger orbits around the planets much closer to the north pole .
<gb> thanks to the Messenger probe that was launched in 2004 , the first to orbit Mercury , <ge> scientists can now be certain .
<gb> however , <ge> this is the deep south of Azerbaijan <gb> , and the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away <ge> .
this is the home of the Caucasian people group <gb> , the Talysh , of whom not much is known except that they speak perfect Persian and Azeri and live long lives <ge> .
the small town is bursting with overpowering architecture from Soviet times <gb> , which doesn &apos;t fit with the picturesque mountain landscape at all <ge> .
<gb> tourists from Europe rarely come here ; <ge> the journey from Azerbaijan &apos;s capital city , Baku , is too arduous .
it takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres <gb> , as too much of the route is just a single track <ge> .
the fabulous wealth <gb> , for which the country has its oil in the Caspian Sea to thank , <ge> has not yet arrives here in the province .
<gb> yet <ge> Pilata Fatulayeva ( 48 ) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to be a tourist attraction .
<gb> &quot; <ge> Baku became famous in May due to the Eurovision Song Contest <gb> , and next year we are having a festival to celebrate the oldest people in the world , &quot; said Fatulayeva <ge> .
she is the Director of the Museum of Longevity <gb> , most likely the only of its kind in the world <ge> .
here the lives of eight dozen Talysh from the area who lived to older than 100 are documented . <gb> Fatulayeva points out a black &amp; white photo . <ge>
the man married three times <gb> and had 23 children , and is said to have fathered another daughter at the age of 136 <ge> .
<gb> due to lacking documentation , however , <ge> there is no scientific proof of age <gb> , particularly as there are no birth registers <ge> .
<gb> or <ge> is it the traditional way of life that keeps the people young ? <gb> in Cengemiran , a tiny settlement not far from the town of Lerik , lives Rubaba Mirzayeva . <ge>
eight people live here under this roof <gb> , including one of Mirzayeva &apos;s sons and a daughter , both of whom have been grandparents for some time <ge> .
<gb> in the kitchen , <ge> tea is prepared <gb> for the guests , which is served <ge> in <gb> typical , bulging <ge> Armadu glasses .
<gb> Mirzayeva &apos;s white teeth stand in perfect rank and file , <ge> beneath her headscarf she conceals long , dark blond plaits <gb> , which her son proudly reveals for us <ge> .
I have always washed my hair with milk <gb> , and it has never fallen out or lost its colour <ge> .
she has only <gb> ever <ge> eaten what she could get from her own farm <gb> - tomatoes , potatoes , peas <ge> .
Mirzayeva receives 230 Manat <gb> ( around the same sum in euros ) <ge> per month as her pension <gb> , which in a local context is an amount on which one can live comfortably <ge> .
<gb> and <ge> perhaps Mirzayeva &apos;s long greying son is right <gb> : &quot; the elderly enjoy a deep respect in our culture <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
his speech was aimed at the entire population <gb> , however in particular at the Coptic Christians , the liberals , enlightened Muslims and secularists <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> Egyptians <gb> - <ge> and the world <gb> - <ge> are not entirely sure what the 61-year-old engineer <gb> who holds a Doctorate from the American University of Southern California , <ge> really wants to save .
<gb> in actual fact , the <ge> 234 articles <gb> , which have been pushed through by the Islamic-dominated 110-person Constituent Assembly , <ge> are in some aspects cause for concern .
<gb> as was also the case under previous constitutions , under the draft <ge> judicature is justified on the &quot; principles of Islamic law . &quot;
<gb> this was and remains subject to interpretation and <ge> there is concern that the Islamists will make use of the woolly formulation and the resulting room for legal manoeuvre in favour of a stricter interpretation of Sharia law .
this can <gb> , but does not necessarily have to <ge> mean that the clergy will oversee legislation <gb> , which would result in the de facto incapacitation of the judiciary <ge> .
<gb> from a legal perspective , this is formulated in such an unclear manner that <ge> state institutions could even use this article to control the content of cinematic art <gb> and literature <ge> .
tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the Tahrir Square in Cairo <gb> , in unfamiliar unity , and pledged to bring down the charter before it has even come into effect <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the revolution is back and we are going to be victorious <gb> , &quot; said Hamdin Sabbahi , third place candidate in the presidential elections <ge> .
noble Peace Prize winner <gb> and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Authority , <ge> Mohamed El-Baradei explained that the constitutional draft belongs <gb> &quot; <ge> on the rubbish tip of history . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> via SMS service Twitter , <ge> he accused Mursi &apos;s followers of wanting to lead &quot; a coup against democracy . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> if he calls for the referendum , we will go to his palace and overthrow him <gb> , &quot; said member of the opposition Jasser Said <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we have not yet grown tired <gb> , the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for , &quot; stated the Egyptian media , quoting opposition politician Chaled Ali <ge> .
<gb> they demanded of Mursi : &quot; cleanse the country ! &quot; and protested : &quot; <ge> the Koran is our constitution . <gb> &quot; <ge>
a struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square <gb> , where everything began , would have most likely <ge> provoked events verging on civil war .
the Muslim Brothers stated that both those against and those in favour <gb> of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear <ge> .
now is the time to let the population decide at the ballot box <gb> , in which direction the country should move forward <ge> .
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutive process <gb> , which actually should have lasted until February and should have involved all social interest groups <ge> .
<gb> &quot; and now <ge> the term human rights does not even appear once in the new constitution <gb> , &quot; he bemoaned in a discussion with &quot; Welt am Sonntag <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
these measures are blatant breaches of the ground rules of democracy <gb> and will guide Egypt into a new dictatorship <ge> .
Saeda feels abandoned <gb> , even by the international community , which is observing the battle over the ideological direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement <ge> .
<gb> one demonstrator at the Tahrir warned : &quot; <ge> you are letting loose a monster that you can no longer control . <gb> &quot; <ge>
Norway &apos;s <gb> five million <ge> people enjoy <gb> one of the <ge> highest standards of living <gb> , not just in Europe , but in the world <ge> .
could the secret of <gb> the country &apos;s <ge> success be connected to <gb> the local <ge> appetite for <gb> some exceedingly <ge> smelly fish ?
rakfisk is trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water <gb> for - depending on how smelly you like your fish - up to a year <ge> .
<gb> as the dark sets in and the weather turns cold , <ge> Norwegians flock to a festival <gb> here in Fagernes <ge> devoted to this most , well , captivating of foods .
&quot; you eat it raw , and then swallow a glass of aquavit , <gb> &quot; says Havard Halvarsen , full-time local firefighter but also the so-called &quot; Rakfisk General , &quot; in charge of running the festival <ge> .
if you can avoid passing it under your nose , it is not bad <gb> - not unlike a slice of sushi that has been on rather a long bus journey <ge> .
rakfisk is a product of very different , poverty-stricken times in Norway <gb> when , pre-refrigeration , fish was soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in autumn <ge> .
<gb> then <ge> in the depths of winter , <gb> well and truly fermented , <ge> it is taken out <gb> and - no doubt with the senses knocked out by alcohol - eaten <ge> .
<gb> now <ge> the population is expanding fast - more than 13 % are immigrants <gb> , attracted by plentiful jobs , high wages and a comprehensive care system <ge> .
people from Sweden <gb> , the old rival and not so long ago far richer than Norway , <ge> stream in to work .
but then everything is expensive <gb> - a small glass of beer or a sandwich knock you back ¬£ 9 ( $ 14 ) each <ge> .
Norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda <gb> - and most seem to like it that way <ge> .
people here are still loath to mention by name Anders Breivik <gb> , the right-wing , racist extremist who gunned down and killed 77 men , women and children last year <ge> .
Norwegians find it <gb> very <ge> difficult to believe that <gb> in their peace-loving country <ge> one of their own was capable of such brutality <gb> and murder <ge> .
<gb> Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - <ge> all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund <gb> for the benefit of future generations <ge> .
when everyone else was throwing around money they did not have <gb> , in the years leading up to the global financial crash , <ge> Norway kept its purse strings tightly bound .
&quot; as long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer <gb> we are happy <ge> , &quot; says Anna .
the hotel I am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a rakfisk dinner <gb> where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most nasally challenging - fish <ge> .
there is a live TV link up to a compere <gb> in a bow tie surrounded by plates of rakfisk <ge> .
a congested city at the best of times <gb> , a ring of steel has been erected since Monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads <ge> .
the aim <gb> , however , <ge> wasn &apos;t to stop commuters <gb> getting to work but prevent protesters from reaching parliament <ge> .
<gb> on Saturday , <ge> Mexico &apos;s new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential sash <gb> and take over the running of the nation <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> my government has a great commitment to the Mexican people <gb> to reduce the violence , &quot; Mr Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week <ge> .
<gb> before rubbing shoulders with the US president , <ge> Mr Pena Nieto &apos;s previous political experience was as governor of his home state <gb> , the State of Mexico <ge> .
<gb> a populous , sprawling state surrounding the capital , <ge> opinions about the new leader are divided <gb> in his old stomping ground <ge> .
to reach the town you can drive along one of <gb> Mr Pena <ge> Nieto &apos;s new motorways <gb> , a vast improvement on the cracked and bumpy roads it replaced <ge> .
plaques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre <gb> and an impressive interactive museum about climate change <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change <gb> , &quot; says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez , a state congressman for Mr Pena Nieto &apos;s party , the PRI <ge> .
<gb> particularly in terms of security and the economy , <ge> we &apos;re hoping for an interesting and true change <gb> which our country so badly needs <ge> .
<gb> but on the other side of the state , <ge> that is not the impression many people have of their former governor .
<gb> earlier this year , <ge> the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs <gb> operating in the neighbourhoods , and violence against women is particularly acute <ge> .
<gb> on a patch of wasteland by a vast landfill site , <ge> the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped over the past two years alone .
more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr Pena Nieto was governor , a rate <gb> much <ge> higher than in the <gb> notoriously violent <ge> city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of <gb> innocent <ge> women .
<gb> Mr Pena Nieto &apos;s critics say , at best , <ge> he failed to adequately address the problem of femicide while he was in office .
<gb> as her mother recounts the story , <ge> a picture of Mariana looks down from the walls <gb> , next to a cross bearing a single word : justice <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> but that can &apos;t be right <gb> when there were so many irregularities and omissions , &quot; she says <ge> .
tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico <gb> over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I hope he &apos;s the same kind of president as he was a governor , <gb> &quot; says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo . <ge>
<gb> when Fein asked about the forms Friday , <ge> Manning acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guards as <gb> &quot; <ge> excellent <gb> &quot; and treatment by the facility overall as &quot; very professional <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
manning responded that he would verbally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers <gb> would talk through the <ge> concerns and indicate that they would be addressed , but they didn &apos;t record the issues .
the judge <gb> , Army Col. Denise Lind , also <ge> asked Manning why he didn &apos;t complain about his treatment <gb> during a January 2011 meeting with a board <ge> examining the suicidal thoughts <gb> he expressed in a form months earlier <ge> .
<gb> manning replied that <ge> his intention during that meeting was to get his &quot; prevention of injury &quot; status downgraded .
<gb> the military said <ge> they put him on this restrictive status <gb> -- a step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others <ge> .
&quot; I wanted staff to know I was fine , and ( I wanted to ) get off the POI status <gb> ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my viewpoint , &quot; Manning said <ge> .
once at Quantico , Manning said , he spend most days in a small cell <gb> -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- <ge> with no company .
he said he tried to keep moving <gb> , because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules <ge> .
if guards could not see his face <gb> when he rolled over at night <ge> , he said they would wake him to roll back over .
<gb> manning had testified that <ge> he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blanket <gb> during the head count <ge> .
manning testified <gb> Thursday <ge> that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night <gb> because of his attempt to show an officer that he wasn &apos;t a danger to himself <ge> .
manning said that he told the officer that he could have used the waistband of his underwear <gb> or his flip-flops to hurt himself but hadn &apos;t done so <ge> .
the defense <gb> has said it <ge> plans to have Manning plead guilty to lesser offenses <gb> and fight other charges as being too extreme <ge> .
the hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend <gb> , with prosecutors expected to argue that the detention conditions were warranted <ge> .
counts <gb> against Manning <ge> include aiding the enemy <gb> , wrongfully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet , transmitting national defense information <ge> and theft of public property <gb> or records <ge> .
<gb> on a recent trip to Mexico City , <ge> I had barely made my way down the concourse <gb> and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got stumped <ge> .
<gb> I thought about that moment this week when <ge> Mexican president-elect Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama .
pena Nieto was <gb> also <ge> eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy <gb> , which is one reason that Mexicans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States <ge> .
he wants to partner with the United States and Canada <gb> , and create a European Union-style trading bloc in North America <ge> .
<gb> and <ge> Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico &apos;s war against the drug cartels <gb> , even though he offered no specifics <ge> .
most Americans <gb> probably <ge> never give a thought to the fact <gb> that , in 1848 , the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of rifle <ge> .
Mexico has winners and losers <gb> , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it doesn &apos;t <ge> .
<gb> besides , <ge> we &apos;re aware that many of the elite Mexicans in the ruling class don &apos;t like us .
<gb> and <ge> we <gb> wouldn &apos;t now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain , living well in the United States but lost souls nonetheless . <ge>
<gb> now , to complicate the relationship even further , as I learned during my trip , <ge> some Mexican leaders <gb> and parts of the intelligentsia <ge> want to reconnect with the Diaspora .
they want to put Mexican-Americans to work as makeshift <gb> &quot; <ge> ambassadors <gb> &quot; for Mexico , representing its interest in the United States <ge> .
we would <gb> tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and <ge> pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico .
<gb> and , with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence , <ge> many of us are not so sure that it is a great country .
the leaders of Hamas <gb> , the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , <ge> will claim to have forced the Israelis to back off <gb> , even though Gaza has taken a drubbing <ge> .
<gb> despite killing some of its leaders and bottling up Gaza &apos;s 1.7m people in one of the most wretched and crowded corners of the planet , <ge> Israel has failed to destroy Hamas .
<gb> indeed <ge> Hamas is gaining on the West Bank <gb> , the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in Fatah , the more moderate Palestinian faction <ge> .
Turkey , a resurgent regional power that was once Israel &apos;s closest Muslim ally , has taken up Hamas &apos;s cause <gb> ; so has Qatar , one of the richest and most dynamic of the Gulf states <ge> .
<gb> above all , on Israel &apos;s southern flank , <ge> the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt <gb> , by far the most populous and pivotal of Arab countries , <ge> has changed the region &apos;s balance .
Israel &apos;s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proved its worth <gb> and many of Hamas &apos;s missiles have been destroyed <ge> .
in diplomatic terms , America is as steadfast as ever <gb> ; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence <ge> .
<gb> above all , <ge> Israel has prospered , especially under Binyamin Netanyahu <gb> , a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process <ge> .
Mr Netanyahu <gb> , whose Likud party has merged with an even more hawkish lot under Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to an election on January 22nd , <ge> is sitting pretty .
<gb> if they really ran the West Bank , <ge> would they not fire rockets , just as their compatriots have done in Gaza ?
even if the Islamists <gb> taking power in Egypt and elsewhere <ge> have little love for Israel , their priority will be tackling difficulties at home .
repression is <gb> already <ge> undermining democracy in the Jewish state <gb> , and demography exacerbates this as the Arab population swells <ge> .
the answer remains <gb> the one trumpeted by sensible people on both sides , most of the outside world and this newspaper <ge> : two states , with Israel ceding territory for security .
the hope <gb> - a small one in the short term - <ge> is that the ceasefire will give a little more leverage to outsiders pushing that cause .
that would do more to create a Palestinian state than the imminent bid for virtual statehood <gb> at the UN <ge> .
<gb> apart from the varying health warnings and images <ge> the only difference between the packs , <gb> mandatory from Saturday , <ge> are the brand names , and these are all printed in identical small font .
<gb> Australia &apos;s federal government says <ge> the aim is to deter young people from smoking <gb> by stripping the habit of glamour <ge> .
<gb> while Australia has one of the world &apos;s lowest smoking rates and <ge> the changes will have little impact on multinationals &apos; profits <gb> , other countries are considering similar steps <ge> .
counterfeiters <gb> from China and Indonesia <ge> will bring lots more of these products down to sell on the streets of Australia .
the potential hitch <gb> , experts say , <ge> is the popularity of social media <gb> with the very demographic the plan is targeting <ge> .
<gb> after a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from view , <ge> tobacco marketing has moved online .
Freeman noted an increase in &quot; average Joe &quot; reviews of brands <gb> on social media sites such as YouTube , Twitter and Facebook <ge> .
<gb> James Yu , who runs the King of the Pack tobacconist in central Sydney , said <ge> the uniform packaging made it harder to stack his shelves
<gb> &quot; <ge> it used to take me an hour to unload a delivery <gb> , now it takes me four hours , &quot; Yu said <ge> .
I spent five unexpected hours in an airport <gb> this Thanksgiving holiday when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive <ge> .
half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty tedious <gb> , even with the distractions of books , magazines and iPhones ( not to mention duty-free shopping ) <ge> .
it &apos;s all right for us - and our children - to be bored on occasion <gb> , they say <ge> .
<gb> and because <ge> most of us are almost consistently plugged into one screen or another these days , we don &apos;t experience the benefits of boredom .
the trouble is that it has been defined <gb> , and discussed , <ge> in many different ways <gb> , said John D. Eastwood , an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario , Canada <ge> .
what separates boredom from apathy <gb> , he said , <ge> is that the person is not engaged but wants to be .
the core experience of boredom , he said , is &quot; disruption of the attention process , <gb> associated <ge> with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slowly . &quot;
<gb> but Professor Eastwood said that while they can be related , <ge> people who are bored tend to see the problem as the environment or the world <gb> , while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves <ge> .
some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program <gb> in the next room <ge> , others heard it at a low level <gb> so it was <ge> barely noticeable , while the third group didn &apos;t hear the soundtrack at all .
the ones who heard the low-level TV reported more boredom than the other two groups <gb> - they had difficulty concentrating but were not sure why , and attributed that difficulty to boredom <ge> .
<gb> on the other hand , when you &apos;re doing something dull , &quot; such as looking for bad widgets on a factory line , <ge> distracting music can help you not be bored . <gb> &quot; <ge>
we all experience boredom <gb> at some points - my flight delay , a droning speaker , a particularly tedious movie <ge> .
Professor Larson said he did not know <gb> whether the boredom percentages now , 21 years later , would be higher or lower <ge> .
<gb> but he said he did know that &quot; <ge> adolescence is a peak period for boredom <gb> , &quot; largely because children and teenagers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do <ge> .
<gb> sometimes no , <ge> because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks <gb> , gamble or indulge in substance abuse as a way to ease it , research shows <ge> .
<gb> on the other hand , <ge> many philosophers and writers discuss the connection between boredom and creativity <gb> , said Professor Vodanovich , who has been studying the issue for more than two decades <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> boredom is the brain &apos;s way to tell you you should be doing something else <gb> , &quot; said Gary Marcus , a professor of psychology at N.Y.U. <ge>
if you &apos;re bored and use that energy <gb> to play guitar and cook <ge> , it will make you happy .
<gb> but <ge> if you watch TV , it may make you happy in the short term <gb> , but not in the long term <ge> .
<gb> so if your child is bored and you give him an iPad , he may not be bored anymore , <ge> but he <gb> hasn &apos;t learned how to entertain himself , or self regulate , Professor Fenske said . <ge>
what people are really searching for <gb> , he said , <ge> is a way to unplug and enjoy down time .
<gb> Mr. Orozco said that <ge> one day in September he and a few friends were driving in Lamar <gb> , on the plains near the Kansas border , when they were pulled over <ge> .
<gb> after the police officer found marijuana in the car , <ge> Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for possession and drug paraphernalia <gb> - petty offenses that each carry a $ 100 fine - and given a court date <ge> .
<gb> in the uncertain weeks after Colorado &apos;s vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use , <ge> the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location .
police departments have stopped charging adults 21 years and older for small-scale possession <gb> that will be legally sanctioned once the laws take effect in the coming weeks <ge> .
<gb> but <ge> prosecutors <gb> in more conservative precincts in Colorado <ge> have vowed to press ahead with existing marijuana cases <gb> and are still citing people for possession <ge> .
<gb> at the same time , <ge> several towns <gb> from the Denver suburbs to the Western mountains <ge> are voting to block new , state-licensed retail marijuana shops <gb> from opening in their communities <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> this thing is evolving so quickly that I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen next <gb> , &quot; said Daniel J. Oates , the police chief in Aurora , just east of Denver <ge> .
<gb> and <ge> they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses <gb> for production , manufacturing , distribution and sales - all by a deadline of Dec. 1 , 2013 <ge> .
<gb> they say that <ge> Colorado , <gb> for better or worse , <ge> is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana <gb> , first for medical use and now recreationally <ge> .
<gb> chief Oates said that <ge> the police would enforce city codes regulating medical marijuana growers <gb> , and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> our office has an obligation to prosecute offenses <gb> that were crimes at the time they occurred , &quot; Mr. Buck said in a statement <ge> .
the response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County <gb> , where voters rejected the marijuana initiative <ge> .
the police in Grand Junction <gb> , the county &apos;s largest city , <ge> are no longer citing adults <gb> for possession of small amounts <ge> .
the county &apos;s district attorney <gb> , Pete Hautzinger , <ge> supported that decision <gb> , but also decided not to dismiss all of the pending possession cases <ge> .
&quot; I do not think I &apos;m wasting my time <gb> continuing to enforce the law until it changes , &quot; he said <ge> .
although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure <gb> , bringing recreational marijuana into the folds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple <ge> .
<gb> and <ge> the contradictory reactions across the state lay bare a deep ambivalence <gb> among local officials about the state &apos;s big green experiment <ge> .
&quot; it &apos;s a cultural barrier &quot; with district attorneys , said Sean McAllister <gb> , a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> they spent so much of their lives prosecuting people <gb> that they still don &apos;t really accept that this is legal , &quot; he said <ge> .
<gb> as the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol , <ge> Colorado and Washington are poised to become national test cases <gb> for drug legalization <ge> .
<gb> as advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of legalized sales , <ge> they are <gb> also <ge> anxiously awaiting direction from the federal government <gb> , which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes <ge> .
<gb> despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers , <ge> the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado , Washington and 16 other states .
<gb> last week , <ge> the western city of Montrose took up a six-month ban <gb> , and is likely to pass it next week <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we don &apos;t want to be put in a position where we license somebody <gb> and then have a big federal issue , &quot; said Bob Nicholson , a City Council member <ge> .
<gb> both <ge> my father and my elder brother had been at <gb> what I imagined was the world &apos;s greatest seat of learning , <ge> a modern-day wine-blushed Greek symposium <gb> encouraging the dual pillars of civilisation , free thinking and tolerance <ge> .
<gb> yet , within two weeks of taking up my place at Worcester College in the late Eighties to read history , <ge> I &apos;d packed my bags , precipitating the first scandal of my life .
<gb> the Evening Standard diary claimed I &apos;d quit because <ge> I objected to fellow undergraduates having sex in the room next to mine .
<gb> the writer <ge> A N Wilson announced <gb> waggishly <ge> that I &apos;d departed <gb> because I was forced to drink out of chipped mugs <ge> .
not on account of my rather outr√© name <gb> , or the fact that I came from a private school <ge> .
<gb> such is the institutionalised and increasing hatred of Tory students at Oxford that last week <ge> a group of them demanded the same equal-rights protection as gays <gb> , disabled people and ethnic minorities <ge> .
conservative members <gb> of Corpus Christi College &apos;s junior common room ( JCR ) <ge> claim they are &quot; <gb> often actively isolated , <ge> personally attacked <gb> and made to feel unwelcome <ge> &quot; <gb> because of their political views <ge> .
they want to create a post on the college &apos;s equal opportunities committee <gb> to ensure that their opinions can be aired freely <ge> .
their situation wasn &apos;t helped by a recent <gb> BBC Two <ge> documentary <gb> , Wonderland : young , Bright and on the Right , about student politics , which portrayed Tories as oddballs and neo-Nazis <ge> .
it featured graduate Joe Cooke <gb> , former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association ( OUCA ) , <ge> travelling in a Rolls-Royce , sporting a silver suit and silver-topped cane .
<gb> at other universities , <ge> Conservative students say they are being treated as <gb> &quot; <ge> scapegoats <gb> &quot; for the introduction of higher tuition fees <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> Luke Black , 20 , vice-president of Nottingham University Conservative Association , told a Sunday newspaper that &quot; <ge> there is a growing Left-wing bias at universities .
<gb> &quot; <ge> this poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion <gb> , as well as to the welfare of members , &quot; she says <ge> .
I was to find that the dons <gb> not only <ge> connived in the taunting of Tory undergraduates <gb> but took part with relish <ge> .
<gb> the politics of the miners &quot; <ge> strike , privatisation and the government &apos;s opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa were brought into the wood-panelled rooms of the tutorial .
<gb> &quot; miss Wyatt , &quot; said the don , Harry Pitt ( now deceased ) , &quot; <ge> please translate the first paragraph . <gb> &quot; <ge>
&quot; I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time <gb> - that is , if you &apos;re not too busy socialising , <ge> &quot; Pitt snarled .
<gb> at dinner in college that evening I sat by myself ; then <ge> I felt a light tap on my shoulder .
<gb> it &apos;s bad enough for me , but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher , so <ge> it will be worse for you .
<gb> a first year PPE student , who , ironically , had been to Eton , said : &quot; <ge> you &apos;re the daughter of a fascist pig . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the only openly Tory don was Norman Stone <gb> , Professor of Modern History , who was based at my college <ge> .
he was hated for being <gb> not only a <ge> Conservative <gb> but a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher <ge> and one of her speech writers .
he loathed the place as provincial and petty <gb> , and for its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history <ge> .
I began commuting from Oxford to my parents &quot; house <gb> in London , finding refuge with my more open-minded metropolitan friends and family <ge> .
during a tutorial the following week , when another history don had suggested , <gb> in complete seriousness , <ge> that I was an &quot; enemy of the people , &quot; I decided to do the same .
<gb> inwardly blushing with shame , <ge> I admitted to being &quot; brainwashed by my parents &quot; and called them &quot; old fools . &quot;
even more tragic is that it was Oxford , which <gb> not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers , but , to this day , <ge> hides behind an ill-deserved reputation for equality <gb> and freedom of thought <ge> .
<gb> on the occasion of the &quot; Valentino : master of Couture , &quot; an exhibition that opened this week in London , <ge> ABC speaks with Naty Abascal , Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other of the Italian designer &apos;s famous clients .
Somerset House <gb> , former home of Queen Elizabeth I of England , <ge> is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Valentino Garavani exhibition .
<gb> during the inauguration of &quot; Valentino : master of Couture , &quot; <ge> the designer acknowledged a retrospective apotheosis that brings together over 130 couture gowns created by his fashion house over the past 50 years .
this exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is &quot; signore &quot; Garavani <gb> , although it could not have been written without his distinguished clients <ge> .
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as if they were trophies of his social ascent <gb> from humble couturier in Voghera , northern Italy , <ge> to idol of the international jet-set .
<gb> in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , <ge> we both lived in the Alps <gb> and were good friends <ge> .
<gb> many years ago , <ge> after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome , we went for dinner at his flat .
you could see and feel his &quot; spirit &quot; in every detail of the flat and its decor <gb> , the food and the music <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> all the guests were made to feel important and loved <gb> &quot; recalls the top model , who started working with him during Haute Couture Week Paris , in 1995 <ge> .
<gb> in this crowd of mannequins , <ge> names stand out such as Sibilla of Luxembourg , Gloria von Thurn und Taxis , Mette-Marit of Norway , Rosario of Bulgaria and Sofia of Habsburg .
<gb> many of these clients say <ge> your first Valentino is like your first love <gb> , &quot; impossible to forget <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
it was a pair of trousers <gb> , a shirt , a &quot; gilet &quot; waistcoat and jacket <ge> from the <gb> 1971-1972 <ge> autumn-winter collection .
<gb> &quot; <ge> it was a gift he gave me <gb> &quot; says Naty Abascal , one of the designer &apos;s muses <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I prefer him to other designers because of his femininity <gb> , his great love of women , and because he enhances our beauty &quot; added the former Duchess of Feria <ge> .
I love the colours he uses <gb> , they really stand out and &quot; lend themselves &quot; to your face <ge> .
<gb> as a teenager living in Italy , <ge> I dreamed of reaching the age when I &apos;d <gb> have the chance to <ge> wear one of his <gb> evening <ge> gowns <gb> ... <ge>
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party <gb> in the castle belonging to my cousin , Prince Edouard de Ligne <ge> .
it was a red dress <gb> , with a frilly skirt , draped &quot; corsage &quot; and a strapless neckline <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> Valentino is indifferent to fashion , his obsession is timeless <gb> &quot; says this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris , New York and Buenos Aires <ge> .
Princess D &apos;Arenberg looks after her couturier gowns with &quot; the utmost care <gb> ... because a dress not just a dress , it &apos;s also the many memories that go with it <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the &quot; grand finale &quot; of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller &apos;s wedding dress <gb> from her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995 <ge> .
<gb> according to journalist Suzy Menkes , the leading authority of the specialist press , <ge> that dress represents a high fashion milestone of the late 20th century <gb> , &quot; the return of high society clients <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> I &apos;ve <gb> always <ge> been struck by his <gb> refined and calm <ge> manner <gb> , and his neat <ge> and <gb> perfect <ge> appearance <gb> &quot; acknowledges D &apos;Arenberg <ge> .
for four euros , the Indonesian volcano porters risk life and limb <gb> carrying 70 kilos of sulphur along steep stone paths <ge> .
this is the case of Anto Wijaya , one of the <gb> 400 <ge> miners who make their living taking sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano <gb> , east of the Indonesian island of Java <ge> .
<gb> to do so , <ge> he has to descend every day to the bottom of the crater <gb> , where the sulphurous gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with air <ge> .
<gb> after breaking off large sulphur rocks , which in total can weigh up to 70 kilos , <ge> he carries them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders along the steep stone paths .
they know that one slip could cost them their lives <gb> , as happened to a French tourist who plunged to her death a few years ago on the hazardous Kawah Ijen cliffs <ge> .
this is PT Ngrimbi Candi , a company which , since 1960 , has been exploiting the volcano <gb> , and quite literally its workers , whom it pays 662 rupees ( 5 euro cents ) per kilo of sulphur <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we generally carry 70 kilos , so we get about 46,000 rupees <gb> ( 3.8 euros ) <ge> a trip <gb> &quot; explains Anto , who usually make three trips a day <ge> .
each one takes three hours and you end up exhausted <gb> , but it means he gets 138,000 rupees ( 11.5 euros ) at the end of the day <ge> .
<gb> although <ge> it seems a pittance for such an inhuman effort <gb> , it is three times what he would earn in the field <ge> .
he has asthma , <gb> he has <ge> difficulty breathing , coughs <gb> constantly <ge> and his eyes are irritated <gb> by the toxic gases from the volcano <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I &apos;ll go on working two more years <gb> because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French &quot; he vows in more than acceptable English <ge> .
<gb> punished for life , this pleasant , intelligent young man could be a tour guide , waiter or hotel receptionist , but instead <ge> he does the work of a mule .
<gb> defying the shadows , <ge> Anto descends the crater and lights the path with a small torch <gb> attached to the helmet he bought with his money <ge> .
&quot; this work is for animals , not people &quot; protests Madrusin <gb> , a burly 42-year porter <ge> who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades <gb> , since leaving school <ge> .
<gb> balancing the basket on his back , <ge> Unainik can only carry 50 kilos <gb> now he is 53 years old <ge> .
<gb> &quot; I won &apos;t retire , <ge> I &apos;ll die here because the volcano has been my whole life <gb> &quot; says Unainik , opening a mouth full of gaps where teeth use to be <ge> .
<gb> time passes , but <ge> poverty perpetuates from generation to generation in one of the hardest jobs in the world <gb> : the one done by human mules in the Kawah Ijen volcano <ge> .
<gb> it may seem unlikely that <ge> these verses are part of an advert for mint sweets <gb> , but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year <ge> .
the phrases are part of a rap and make use of local references <gb> such as &quot; Let &apos;s put a bao ( bun ) in the oven &quot; to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore <ge> .
<gb> its creative director , <ge> Douglas Hamilton , says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their &quot; national duty . &quot;
we are the <gb> world &apos;s <ge> worst at reproducing our own progeny <gb> , so we felt it was an issue we had to address <ge> .
we knew the Government had tried many things <gb> , like launching perfumes with pheromones or organising speed dating evenings <ge> .
a government package for marriages and parents grants up to USD 15,000 per child <gb> , extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits <ge> .
the birth rate in Singapore <gb> , according to its national population division , currently <ge> stands at 1.2 children per woman .
<gb> &quot; <ge> this has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities <gb> , beyond getting married and starting a family &quot; he explains <ge> .
these changes in social norms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single <gb> , and delaying marriage and births , which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore <ge> .
<gb> meanwhile , an EU <ge> immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created resentment among the local population .
<gb> in Singapore , <ge> there are websites where xenophobia <gb> against many new immigrants <ge> is widespread and thinly disguised <gb> , especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating <ge> .
increased immigration is <gb> also <ge> seen as one of the reasons why <gb> , last year , the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence <ge> .
while a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation &apos;s economic growth , <gb> tax revenues , healthcare costs and immigration policies , <ge> in Singapore &apos;s case there are also some unexpected consequences .
its urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments <gb> , known as &quot; shoe boxes , &quot; which can be built in certain areas of the city <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> there is concern that they may promote a single-living lifestyle <gb> and discourage developers who want to build large family houses <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> he admits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to developers <gb> , who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project <ge> .
although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate <gb> , when talking to Singaporeans working in the central financial district , it seems they will not have much impact <ge> .
men and women alike mention their careers <gb> , stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children <ge> .
<gb> so , much as the <ge> Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children <gb> , when it comes to babies , the Singaporeans have the last word <ge> .
<gb> according to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary , <ge> it means the quality of private life or &quot; the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference . <gb> &quot; <ge>
do they understand the dangers <gb> they are exposed to <ge> by airing information <gb> over the Internet which they probably would not share offline <ge> ?
<gb> &quot; <ge> they are very secret secrets <gb> , I &apos;ll tell my mother , but not everybody &quot; he says <ge> .
&quot; I <gb> wouldn &apos;t share a photo that isn &apos;t mine , or that belongs to somebody who &apos;s doing something stupid &quot; he says . <ge>
<gb> the child recognises that <ge> it is bad to post obscene pictures of naked people <gb> , crimes , or write humiliating or aggressive comments <ge> .
<gb> &quot; social networking is fun , <ge> I can talk quickly to relatives far away or my friends <gb> &quot; he says <ge> .
this teenager has accounts with Hotmail , Facebook , My Space and Ask <gb> , and in the last case he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list <ge> .
<gb> &quot; it doesn &apos;t bother me , because <ge> we have something in common <gb> , like music &quot; he says <ge> .
the boy says that no-one has suggested anything to him <gb> or asked him for his home address or phone number <ge> .
<gb> &quot; if they pressured me or asked me for it , <ge> I &apos;d just delete them from my account <gb> &quot; he states <ge> .
I would do it if I didn &apos;t like somebody <gb> , or they made me want to do it <ge> .
<gb> Marielos Porras , an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning , believes that to guide children and teenagers , <ge> they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform .
<gb> Porras says <ge> the scholar Marc Prensky <gb> , with a Master &apos;s degree in Education from Yale University and author of the work Digital Natives , Digital Immigrants , <ge> coined these terms to explain the phenomenon .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we are the digital immigrants who have to teach them <gb> , when we are still in fact learning &quot; he says <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> they <gb> also <ge> have to be selective when what matters most is to <gb> be popular and <ge> have thousands of friends <gb> , without thinking of the consequences &quot; he adds <ge> .
<gb> according to the specialist , <ge> the most effective way to teach children and teenagers what privacy is , is through questions that make them think .
<gb> Porras then lists some options : <ge> there are things you <gb> wouldn &apos;t tell a stranger , so why do it online ? <ge>
<gb> &quot; outside the Internet , <ge> people <gb> act with respect , morality and other principles , so they <ge> should act the same way on social networks <gb> &quot; he says <ge> .
<gb> by understanding all the clauses , <ge> they have solid grounds to talk to their children <gb> about the implications of opening an online account <ge> .
<gb> according to Guardia , <ge> it is important to remind children the &quot; don &apos;t talk to strangers &quot; lesson .
the Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations ( Unasur ) concluded today in Peru <gb> without making public the Lima Declaration , previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attendee leaders <ge> .
when asked about the text , they pointed out that the content had been disclosed by Peruvian President <gb> , Ollanta Humala , during a brief statement to the press <ge> .
the little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press spokesmen of some of the UNASUR governments attending the meeting <gb> , but not the Peruvian Government <ge> .
the only document released during the summit was the list of attending presidents <gb> , which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media , who asked for more details <ge> .
the Peruvian President <gb> then <ge> sent an email to the media with the &quot; final statement &quot; of the summit , but this was Humala &apos;s statement , and not the official document <gb> that closed the summit <ge> .
<gb> last October , <ge> Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American-Arab Countries <gb> ( ASPA ) , and this time , despite repeated requests from the press , the previously announced Lima Declaration was again not made public <ge> .
<gb> at both international events , <ge> the Peruvian authorities were at pains to ensure that there were broadcasting systems assured for all the journalists <gb> , but limited the obtaining of information to a maximum <ge> .
the summit <gb> also <ge> concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling <gb> by the Hague Court to adjudicate a border dispute between the two countries <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we will obey and execute the order that currently defines the differences we are bringing before this international court <gb> &quot; said Humala , together with his Chilean counterpart <ge> .
Paraguay <gb> , which was suspended by UNASUR in 2011 after the dismissal of former President Fernando Lugo , <ge> was not involved in the meeting .
host President Ollanta Humala was responsible for opening the session in the morning and closing the summit <gb> , just after noon in Lima <ge> .
the President read the <gb> final <ge> document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid down for 31 projects between the South American countries <gb> , for a total of 17 billion dollars of investments <ge> .
<gb> among the resolutions adopted , <ge> it was mentioned that UNASUR countries will take <gb> &quot; <ge> important steps <gb> toward the goal of a South American citizenship , for which residence agreements are being extended <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> with Europe in crisis , &quot; <ge> economic consolidation ( in Latin America ) should not have a triumphalist attitude <gb> but should serve to expand its productive matrix and glimpse a better future for its people &quot; Humala added <ge> .
the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous , peaceful and integrated nation , with good neighbourly relations , <gb> was another issue highlighted by the summit . <ge>
<gb> &quot; the day after tomorrow ( Saturday ) <ge> I might have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega <gb> &quot; Santos said <ge> .
<gb> &quot; we will review all these paths , &#91; which &#93; are not exclusive , and <ge> the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua <gb> &quot; he emphasised <ge> .
<gb> &quot; with President Ortega , I hope I can say that <ge> we handle this in the most civilised <gb> and respectful <ge> manner possible <gb> &quot; said Santos <ge> .
<gb> also , as part of the summit , <ge> the bloc &apos;s foreign defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan <gb> , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region <ge> .
<gb> Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Brazil , Uruguay , Venezuela , Chile , Guyana , <ge> Surinam and Paraguay make up UNASUR , although the latter is currently suspended .
<gb> the President of Ecuador , <ge> Rafael Correa , said <gb> today <ge> that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that &quot; South America <gb> , in this case , <ge> must learn from Europe . &quot;
<gb> to this end , <ge> he defended the project to establish South American citizenship <gb> encouraged by member countries of UNASUR <ge> .
&quot; it is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding <gb> &quot; he said referring to Ecuador giving political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange <ge> .
<gb> Correa said <ge> he does not regret that decision <gb> because with it he has not betrayed his principles <ge> , but has respected his &quot; deep democratic and human rights values . &quot;
<gb> &quot; <ge> I have not spoken to him since he was at our embassy <gb> , but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem , nothing serious &quot; said the Ecuadorian President <ge> .
<gb> what <ge> there is <gb> , is <ge> the danger that his <gb> physical and <ge> mental health may deteriorate due to being locked in a small space <gb> without any outdoor exercise <ge> .
we do not negotiate with human rights <gb> , we do not use that word in this case , but there have been ongoing discussions <ge> .
Correa took the opportunity to reassert himself as a defender of freedom of the press <gb> and stated that what he does not tolerate is &quot; the mediocrity , dishonesty and lies that undermine the freedom of expression <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> personally , I &apos;ve never been interested in power , but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador , <ge> socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power .
<gb> &quot; <ge> my political movement believed that it was me who ensured that probable victory <gb> , so we have to accept that responsibility &quot; he said <ge> .
<gb> if I won , <ge> it would be my last period in office <gb> and then I would leave public life <ge> .
<gb> I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicol√°s Maduro and he tells me that <ge> Chavez went for treatment <gb> that was already planned , routine treatment <ge> , <gb> and it was expected <ge> he would win the campaign and return to Cuba .
&quot; it was like a bomb dropped on me &quot; he says , recalling the time of the announcement <gb> , which the doctor was trying to make &quot; softer , &quot; apparently unsuccessfully <ge> .
he decided to care for his illness alone and began to learn about it ; <gb> thanks to his efforts he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday <ge> .
he is <gb> undoubtedly <ge> one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital <gb> ( Chg ) , where he arrived in 1994 after several battles with his health <ge> .
<gb> then , even <ge> the director of an IMSS <gb> &#91; Mexican Social Security Institute &#93; <ge> clinic refused to discharge him <gb> &quot; because he had a cut <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> to gauge this progress , it should be remembered that <ge> the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years .
<gb> &quot; <ge> if I &apos;m going to die , I &apos;d rather have a blow-out three times a week <gb> &quot; they say , but not in my case <ge> .
the gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens are huge <gb> , said Ricardo Salazar , a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the HIV cause <ge> .
<gb> it was decided to change such inefficient allocation , and that <ge> condoms should <gb> not only <ge> be placed behind counters , <gb> but that <ge> packets of one hundred should be <gb> found <ge> in public toilet dispensers <gb> in places <ge> frequented by young people .
it is not about paying for their beers or motel fees <gb> , as Governor Emilio Gonzalez said , when asked if there would be distribution of condoms during his administration <ge> .
<gb> &quot; and it &apos;s not about sexuality , but <ge> it is best to provide condoms to those already practising sexual activity <gb> &quot; he said <ge> .
the state is 4th in the nation in <gb> new and cumulative <ge> cases of AIDS <gb> and 13th in HIV <ge> .
<gb> an estimated <ge> 50,000 people may be living with HIV , as for each registered case there are <gb> around <ge> 4-5 people who do not know they are positive .
it seems <gb> , then , <ge> that the proceedings in support of survival <gb> of firms permit Mexican law <ge> are not valid in the land of stars and stripes <gb> , contrary to international conventions <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> the decision opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico <gb> to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States , claiming three inconsistencies <ge> .
<gb> indeed , <ge> the UN Model Law for International Trade Law Uniformity was created for this purpose <gb> , with the American Law Institute positioned as arbitrator <ge> .
there are half a dozen examples <gb> , including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana , whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute <ge> .
<gb> from another perspective , <ge> the latter blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 <gb> , while trying to avoid the severe economic crisis faced by the United States , turning its back on the country <ge> .
<gb> should this fail , <ge> an appeal for review by a higher court <gb> , in this case the US Supreme Court , <ge> will be filed .
the proceedings headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint <gb> against the National Banking and Securities Commission , which is accused of obstructing justice <ge> .
<gb> as you know , <ge> we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean <gb> , selling Chinese products , with a residential area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies <ge> .
<gb> previously , <ge> Canacintra had managed to unite the governors of the southeast of Mexico <gb> to oppose the monumental building that destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all threats to industry <ge> .
<gb> as you know , <ge> the action was taken even though the Senate had ruled out the possibility <gb> , deeming it an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks <ge> .
<gb> in effort to repay long-term debt without affecting short-term debt , <ge> the housing developer Homex is placing securities exchange certificates on the market for 500 million pesos .
few people in Puerto Rico have a mental recollection of local basketball history <gb> as broad as that of H√©ctor &quot; Hetin &quot; Reyes <ge> .
the walls of his house are almost totally decorated with pictures <gb> and memorabilia denoting his long career , which goes to prove it <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> those were my best years <gb> , the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the Vaqueros &apos; eight championships , since 1967 , either as agent , co-agent or manager <ge> .
<gb> I remember that <ge> Gene Bartow <gb> , who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama ( Birmingham ) , <ge> said to me &apos; I &apos;ve got a very strong player for you <gb> , 6 &apos; 7 &quot; tall <ge> .
Bartow then recommended the Sharpshooter Gausse Raymond <gb> , who established residency here and was one of our best shooters <ge> .
<gb> then came <ge> the 1990 World Cup , where we came fourth and it should have been bronze <gb> , but for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time , said Reyes <ge> .
it &apos;s one of the best <gb> , as good as the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics <ge> .
a team that maybe was not the best in terms of members <gb> , but which gave us a gold medal and was a great joy to work with , was the 1995 Pre-Olympic team in Neuquen , Argentina <ge> .
we had a very good team <gb> , including Julio Toro , Flor Melendez , Carlos Morales , Raymond Dalmau , Armandito Torres <ge> .
<gb> having been part of the National Team &apos;s most glorious era between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 90s <ge> the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season .
<gb> for example , <ge> the boys of Ponce only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs .
at least I see the fruit of <gb> compulsory certifications and a course for leaders , <ge> table officials and referees .
the most I do is listen to music , watch music videos from my era on YouTube <gb> , enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games <ge> .
<gb> and of course , <ge> enjoy the company of my wife <gb> , Elizabeth , who has always been with me <ge> .
Larry Hagman <gb> , whose role as oil tycoon predator JR Ewing in the television series &quot; Dallas &quot; <ge> became a symbol of greed in the 1980s <gb> , has died <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> Larry was back in <gb> his beloved hometown of <ge> Dallas , <gb> once again <ge> representing the <gb> iconic <ge> role he <gb> most <ge> liked <gb> &quot; the family said <ge> .
Linda Gray <gb> , who played his wife in the original series and the sequel , <ge> was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas <gb> , said her publicist , Jeffrey Lane <ge> .
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 <gb> and admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years <ge> .
<gb> years before &quot; Dallas , &quot; <ge> Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy <gb> &quot; I Dream of Jeannie , &quot; aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970 <ge> .
he played Captain Tony Nelson <gb> , an astronaut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive genie , played by Barbara Eden , and takes her home to live with him <ge> .
he also starred in two sitcoms that were not aired for long <gb> , &quot; The Good Life &quot; ( NBC , 1971-72 ) and &quot; Here We Go Again &quot; ( ABC , 1973 ) <ge> .
his film work included roles well received by critics <gb> in &quot; The Group , &quot; &quot; Harry and Tonto &quot; and &quot; Primary Colors <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
but it was his masterful interpretation <gb> of delightfully detestable JR <ge> that led to Hagman reaching his peak of stardom .
the drama series <gb> on CBS about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit <ge> aired from April 1978 to May 1991 .
Jr got her pregnant <gb> then threatened to say she was a prostitute unless she left town , but there were others who also had reasons to attack him <ge> .
Victoria Principal <gb> , co-star of the original series , <ge> recalled Hagman <gb> on Friday as someone &quot; huge , on and off screen <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
he is unforgettable and irreplaceable <gb> , for millions of fans around the world , and in the hearts of each one of us who was fortunate enough to know and love him <ge> .
ten episodes of <gb> the new edition of &quot; <ge> Dallas <gb> &quot; <ge> were broadcast <gb> a few months ago <ge> with great success <gb> for TNT <ge> .
he had already finished recording five episodes for the second series <gb> and a sixth was in process , the chain reported <ge> .
<gb> immediately after , <ge> there was no statement from Warner or TNT <gb> about how the series would handle the loss of Hagman <ge> .
Hagman <gb> , born in Fort Worth , Texas , <ge> was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin , <gb> who starred in classics such as &quot; South Pacific &quot; and &quot; Peter Pan . &quot; <ge>
he tried his luck in the New York theatre scene in the early &apos; 50s <gb> , and later served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 , in England <ge> .
the couple had two sons , Preston and Heidi , and lived for a long time in the Californian city Malibu <gb> , home to many celebrities <ge> .
<gb> in 2001 , <ge> he called his memoirs &quot; Hello <gb> Darlin &apos; : tall ( and Absolutely True ) Tales About My Life . &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> I didn &apos;t put anything in it that I believed would hurt anyone or affect them in any way <gb> &quot; he told Associated Press at the time <ge> .
<gb> after his liver transplant , <ge> he became an organ donation promoter <gb> and worked as a volunteer at a hospital , helping fearful patients <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I <gb> advise them , encourage them , <ge> meet with them when they come for their surgery <gb> , and afterwards &quot; he said in 1996 <ge> .
I try to offer some comfort <gb> , such as &quot; Don &apos;t be afraid , it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time , but then you &apos;ll be fine <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
&quot; I didn &apos;t realise this was going to be the most apocalyptic term ever &quot; said charm√© <gb> this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University ( New Jersey ) <ge> .
if you look at what has been happening in the world <gb> today as if we were at 30 days and counting <ge> , this has been a really good period .
and he is not the only professor who offers courses on the &quot; end of the world <gb> &quot; this term , theoretically the last in history <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we looked at why these ideas proliferate over time <gb> &quot; he said , and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide human behaviour <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I &apos;ve tried to inform students about what is possible <gb> , probable , credible and impossible &quot; said vacker <ge> .
<gb> at Penn State , <ge> the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse <gb> , which leaves students no choice but to work &quot; until the very night the world is supposed to end &quot; said Restall <ge> .
we received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the term <gb> , from people asking if there were any places <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves <gb> &quot; said Bridgid Robinson , a 23-year-old post-graduate Religion and Sociology student from Haddonfield , New Jersey , at Rutgers-Camden <ge> .
will Wekesa <gb> , a 25-year-old post-graduate Psychology and Nursing student , <ge> said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies .
&quot; our first project was about the Mayan prophecy and to a certain extent we discredited it &quot; said Julie Zeglen <gb> , a 21-year-old final year student at Temple , from West Chester <ge> .
<gb> but he said that <ge> Western culture suffers from apocalyptic anxiety <gb> , which goes back several centuries , in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the Philippines are not taking part in the end of the world <gb> &quot; he wrote , suggesting an exception of a higher authority <ge> .
