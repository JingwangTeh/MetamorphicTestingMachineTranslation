today , the Ukraine parliament dismissed <gb> , within the Code of Criminal Procedure amendment , <ge> the motion to revoke an article <gb> based on which the opposition leader , Yulia Tymoshenko , was sentenced <ge> .
the amendment <gb> that would lead to freeing the imprisoned former Prime Minister <ge> was revoked <gb> during second reading of the proposal <ge> for mitigation of sentences for economic offences .
in October , Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison <gb> for entering into what was reported to be a disadvantageous gas deal with Russia <ge> .
<gb> Tymoshenko claims <ge> the verdict is a political revenge of the regime <gb> ; in the West , the trial has also evoked suspicion of being biased <ge> .
the proposal <gb> to remove Article 365 from the Code of Criminal Procedure , upon which the former Prime Minister was sentenced , <ge> was supported by 147 members of parliament .
Muammar Kaddafi is buried at an unknown place in the desert . <gb> without him , the war is over . <ge>
<gb> as a rule , Islamists win in the country ; <ge> the question is whether they are the moderate or the radical ones .
the transitional cabinet declared itself a follower of the customary Sharia law <gb> , of which we have already heard <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> our lifestyle is neither unique nor the best one and would not <gb> , most probably , <ge> be suitable for <gb> , for example , <ge> the people of Libya .
their only excuse is that <gb> from their point of view , <ge> NATO raids were not controlled by an American general <gb> , but Allah , the greatness of whom they celebrated with each strike <ge> .
we participated in a shooting <gb> , served Islam , and our politicians got rid of a dictator , their political ally , without any guarantee of profit <ge> .
<gb> it is quite likely that they will not . <ge> the West will then <gb> finally <ge> be able to boast about its selfless protection of human rights .
investors are no longer looking at only Italy <gb> ; they now focus on Spain , France , Austria , and others <ge> .
eurozone statistical offices <gb> in Germany , Czech Republic , and some other countries , <ge> released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter .
<gb> between the quarters though , the GDP stagnated . according to the Czech Statistical Office , <ge> this confirmed the trend of a <gb> gradual <ge> slowing of economic growth .
in this year &apos;s third quarter , Czech economy showed an interim increase of 1.5 % <gb> ; however , it stagnated between the quarters <ge> .
between July and September , the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union grew <gb> , compared to the previous quarter , <ge> by 0.2 % <gb> , which corresponds with estimates by analysts <ge> .
despite the fact that the situation <gb> in the region <ge> is getting worse , earnings <gb> of Czech 1 - year bonds <ge> stay under 4 % .
<gb> the wonderful Petr <ge> Čech is one of the reasons the <gb> Czech <ge> representation team will not miss the next year &apos;s European Championship . <gb> and Czech football will thus gain nearly 200 million Czech Crowns . <ge>
<gb> both teams found it difficult to join in the combination ; <ge> the game remained around the mid-field line most of the time .
<gb> that was also why <ge> there was no pressure from the home team <gb> in the first half . long kicks behind the defence were neatly averted by the Czech defence <ge> .
<gb> at Tuesday noon , <ge> students &apos; prayers <gb> in front of the building <ge> were followed by their chanting of death to both the USA and Israel .
in its recent report , <gb> the International Atomic Energy Agency ( <ge> IAEA <gb> ) <ge> stated that <gb> everything leads to the conclusion that <ge> Iran has not stopped striving for a nuclear weapon .
<gb> at Tuesday noon , <ge> students &apos; prayers <gb> in front of the entrance into Isfahan Uranium Conversion Facility <ge> were followed by their chanting of death to both the USA and Israel .
<gb> again , <ge> we can see the importance of the environment and models surrounding a human being for his or her healthy development .
<gb> for example , <ge> sausages occur <gb> up to half <ge> more frequently on the tables of obese children compared to the families of children with standard weight .
over 19 % of obese children had fried chips for dinner <gb> the day before the research connected to the educational event called Obesity is No Accident <ge> .
the research took place at the end of last year &apos;s school year <gb> ; it included almost 900 elementary school children from throughout Bohemia <ge> .
it was the second year of the Obesity is No Accident event supported by <gb> both <ge> Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna <gb> insurance company <ge> and Unilever .
<gb> so far , <ge> the project has been joined by over 12 thousand school children <gb> from 4th to 8th grades <ge> .
proper diet and sufficient sports activities represent key defining factors <gb> causing dramatically growing number of children who are either overweight or obese <ge> .
the worst discovery was the fact that <gb> in one tenth of households <ge> people do not have breakfast at all .
though over 40 % of children do sports <gb> regularly <ge> , the number drops down <gb> to less than a half - 15 % - <ge> when it comes to their parents .
another part of the survey allowed selected children <gb> ( 204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools ) <ge> to compose their own menu <gb> based on selection offered and their taste and opinions <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> diet preferences of Czech children <gb> between 12 and 15 <ge> are far from ideal as <gb> regards <ge> healthy diet . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> especially alarming is the high popularity of sweet soft drinks <gb> , &quot; the final report of the survey concludes <ge> .
the survey <gb> also <ge> showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits <gb> provided they are given correct information <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> many participants <gb> from the survey control group <ge> showed a significant shift of preferences towards healthy food <gb> when completing a questionnaire after the end of the Obesity is No Accident educational lecture , &quot; project results show <ge> .
<gb> in addition , for their main course , <ge> children ticked poultry and fish more often <gb> , limiting sweet meals and dumplings <ge> .
<gb> in the opening article on stylist training , <ge> I was complaining a bit about the amount of information in the introductory lessons .
lectures by three experts from the field ; dressing tips for <gb> difficult <ge> figures ; <gb> and <ge> a seminar on how it works in practise .
this time , together with Alenka <gb> , the Director , ( there is not a single man in the course ) <ge> we discussed how to dress a woman <gb> whose body is not in perfect symmetry <ge> .
<gb> one has a short neck , <ge> the other has a boyish figure without proper curves <gb> , yet another is overweight <ge> .
a stylist must know how to <gb> optically soften wide shoulders , make the neck look longer , or <ge> add the curves necessary .
in a custom-made skirt , you will feel much better <gb> than in one that keeps shifting , rolling up , sticking out in your waist , etc <ge> .
boyish figures <gb> , on the other hand , <ge> can wear clothes with ruffling <gb> , appliqué , embroidery , or shirring <ge> .
<gb> given the abundance of such information and figure types , <ge> I am glad to have a whole week to sort it all out in my head .
we must cut the clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet <gb> and print and graphically process them <ge> .
Saturday &apos;s lecture <gb> , filled with information on figure types , <ge> was livened up by three guests from the field .
a stylist , <gb> Honza Pokorný ; <ge> a fashion designer , <gb> Jakub Polanka ; <ge> and a fashion photographer <gb> , Ben Renč <ge> .
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion <gb> , and a stylist should be able to use this fact <ge> .
<gb> for example , <ge> a trench coat may be worn in the standard way , <gb> over jeans and T-shirt , as a coat ; <ge> but it may also be worn on naked body <gb> , with step-ins , as a dress <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> I appreciated the following advice the most <gb> : &quot; for your work , you need to know the rules perfectly <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
here I finally understood why we drill all the definitions <gb> and rules <ge> of what to combine with what <gb> and why , while in fashion magazines we often see something else <ge> .
from Ben <gb> , the photographer , <ge> I learned that a stylist must have more outfit versions prepared <gb> than the number he is to take pictures of <ge> .
<gb> so , <ge> for a ten-page fashion story <gb> ( equals ten outfits ) <ge> , I have to be ready to create at least fifteen of them .
now I also know that <gb> in the picture , <ge> a piece of clothing often looks <gb> and functions in combination with others completely <ge> different from reality .
<gb> just look at Madonna , who is no miraculous singer , <ge> yet her image <gb> and marketing <ge> turned her into a worldwide star .
and if someone <gb> finally <ge> lets us create their styling , then we should expect them to give us different <gb> ( smaller ) <ge> size than what they really wear .
<gb> on Sunday , <ge> both Honza and Mario were stressing <gb> the fact <ge> that <gb> for a stylist <ge> it is not enough to <gb> know about fashion and <ge> be able to create an outfit .
<gb> our work chiefly consists of communicating with people we dress ; <ge> it is <gb> therefore <ge> important to be a good psychologist .
<gb> &quot; <ge> if a manager asks you to go through her clothes <gb> and add some nice pieces <ge> , you cannot throw out her entire wardrobe <gb> telling her how awful the clothes are <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> find at least a few pieces you can praise <gb> , and recommend what to wear them with &quot; Mario says <ge> .
<gb> even <ge> when taking photographs in a studio where the surface is even , the soles might get damaged <gb> - not to mention shooting outside <ge> .
<gb> I am beginning to realise that <ge> to be a professional stylist is no piece of cake <gb> , no matter what people say <ge> .
an originally carefree ride turned into a <gb> routine morning <ge> drive to work <gb> because of a series of completely superfluous and sloppy mistakes <ge> .
<gb> the ambitions were met to a certain point , but it does not matter since <ge> nobody obviously wanted to do any extra work .
it promised to shift the old <gb> Need For Speed <ge> racing series in a new direction <gb> ; the demos made it look like a game that might stand up in the action racing genre <ge> .
the game represents a possibly decent arcade race <gb> , but the whole is burdened by several unnecessary mistakes featured in the series for a number of years <ge> .
you are introduced into a story , where the main character <gb> , Jack , <ge> decides to solve some personal issues <gb> by participating in an illegal race across America <ge> .
<gb> you get in the car on the west coast , in San Francisco , and <ge> your task is to be the first one to reach New York .
this means each race takes place on a different route <gb> , and given stages are set in varied and interesting environments <ge> .
<gb> despite the graphics being on the same level of previous parts of the series , <ge> some of the environments are very nice to look at .
they are just interactive animations , where <gb> most of the time <ge> Jack is running away from someone <gb> and you need to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time <ge> .
<gb> it is a surprise though , that <ge> these parts are much less in number than you would expect <gb> ( just three to be precise ) <ge> .
still , this driving model is fully suitable for the action style racing <gb> , even though we could find better at the competition <ge> .
from a game of this type , one does not expect complicated <gb> deformations and <ge> collisions <gb> , but when you have no idea , before crashing into any object , how your car will act , something is not right <ge> .
this is not such a big deal due to the restart system <gb> , but is enough to spoil the fun <ge> .
<gb> the restarts are done so that <ge> if you crash <gb> or get far off the track <ge> , the game takes you back to the last interrupted point .
this makes it an aid in case something does not work out , but you cannot rely on it <gb> completely <ge> .
<gb> sometimes <ge> the restarts are not enough and you need to learn a given section of the race by heart .
a significant shortcoming <gb> of the game <ge> is <gb> the fact <ge> that the same things often happen in the same places .
<gb> for example , <ge> some turns have to be driven through in a specific way <gb> , otherwise you simply do not fit in <ge> .
at other times you meet civilian cars <gb> at a given place <ge> in the very same configuration <gb> , no matter if you come first , fifth , five seconds earlier , or one minute later <ge> .
it makes no difference when you get to them <gb> ; everything is set so that the situation always occurs just in front of your nose <ge> .
this is most obvious at the end of the game <gb> , on a long bridge , where you are driving in the opposite direction <ge> .
one can understand the attempt at making the game more interesting and adrenalin-filled <gb> , but it is so obvious it gets annoying quickly <ge> .
it &apos;s a pity , because <gb> despite the simple driving model , <ge> the game is entertaining <gb> and sometimes even so full of action you do not have time to pay attention to what is happening around you <ge> .
it is not important whether the reason you do not get bored is <gb> the concept with fifty unique tracks , ordering of races , or <ge> something else .
you have to watch out for gas stations <gb> along the way <ge> , as that is where you car may change <gb> despite the fact that in most of the cases the one you have is fully sufficient <ge> .
sports cars are <gb> suitable <ge> for cities <gb> ; <ge> strong <gb> American <ge> cars for straight highway sections ; <gb> and <ge> exotic supersports cars for technical driving <gb> , such as along crooked mountain tracks <ge> .
<gb> the key story mode is closely connected with the challenge mode ; <ge> these are the races in individual locations you know from the story .
<gb> here , <ge> you gain both medals and experience points <gb> for your profile , common for both challenges and the story <ge> .
you <gb> and your car <ge> get into a subway tunnel <gb> ( let &apos;s say you do ) <ge> , where you speed down the tracks <gb> in the darkness ( let &apos;s say you do ) <ge> .
for several days , our editorial staff kept discussing whether <gb> when designing the game no one thought for a moment or whether <ge> its authors really think we are such morons .
the technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary <gb> ; but the <ge> overall visual impression is mostly pleasant <gb> , sometimes even great <ge> .
it is a pity though , that <gb> in some dramatic moments , <ge> the recording <gb> , in some cases rather tragically , <ge> decreases .
this especially concerns accidents with large number of participants <gb> , where fluent recoding would not help you much anyway <ge> .
in order to please the <gb> widest possible young <ge> audience , the soundtrack is <gb> &apos; <ge> flecked in from all quarters <gb> &apos; ; but there probably will not be many people buying the game because of its music <ge> .
it surely is a nice entertainment <gb> , but prepare to be blinded by the mistakes with the strength of airport spotlights <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> participating choirs include the Choir of the Pedagogical Department <gb> and Humanities ; Václav Hampl , the Rector , will be in the committee , &quot; Jakub Čaloun , head of the organisation team says <ge> .
in the evening , <gb> in the ceremonial National House in Vinohrady , <ge> there will be a <gb> &quot; Students for Velvet &quot; <ge> concert <gb> , <ge> featuring university choirs <gb> , including those from the Charles University <ge> .
the chief organiser is <gb> českých pěveckých <ge> sborů <gb> ( Czech Choirs ) <ge> in cooperation with Jan Kepler &apos;s Grammar School .
the entire event is under the auspices of Bohuslav Svoboda <gb> , Lord Mayor of Prague , and Václav Hampl , Rector of Charles University <ge> .
<gb> &quot; at first , <ge> critics said he was <gb> plain , <ge> a grey office mouse who cannot fulfil any roles <gb> ; I have to say everyone was amazed at how wonderfully he acquitted his role <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> he is a person who <gb> can listen to all twenty-seven member states , communicate with them perfectly , and who <ge> has a clear vision of where the EU should be headed . <gb> &quot; <ge>
Vicenová further focused on the agenda crucial for the EU <gb> in the past , present , and near future <ge> .
she said the fall of the government at the time was a great negative <gb> causing significant damage to the Czech Republic <ge> .
<gb> in addition , <ge> a new seven-year EU budget needs to be passed <gb> , which is very complicated due to the current crisis <ge> .
she thinks numerous factors are to blame <gb> : for example , the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters ; together with low support from the Czech side <ge> .
<gb> rather than a new European Federation , <ge> she finds the concept of two-speed <gb> , if not multi-speed Europe , <ge> very realistic .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the number of such institutes will be growing ; it will be a highly two-speed Europe <gb> , &quot; Vicenová expects <ge> .
should someone search for the word <gb> that would best express the IMB strategy <ge> , the closest one would <gb> probably <ge> be &quot; long-term . &quot;
to the wide public , IMB is a symbol of technological revolution <gb> ; the company is seen as a highly temporary one , yet it was founded over a hundred years ago <ge> .
<gb> he believed in his motto saying that <ge> numerous world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think .
his motto <gb> : &apos; think ! &apos; thus <ge> become an imprint around which the life of the future giant would unfold <gb> ( as well as the name of its internal magazine that IMB started to publish in 1935 ) <ge> .
in the second century , we hope to be able to achieve even more <gb> , &quot; says current company Director , Samuel J. Palmisano , on the occasion of the anniversary <ge> .
<gb> she has been working in IMB for thirty years ; <ge> she is currently a Director of Sales <gb> , Marketing , and Strategy <ge> .
<gb> &quot; IBM is not a technology firm ; <ge> it is a company that helps to solve business problems using technology <gb> , &quot; George Colony of Forrester Research consultation company adds <ge> .
during the hundred years , IMB <gb> , or the &quot; Big Blue , &quot; as it is called in the US because of its logo , <ge> has grown into one of the largest companies in the world .
its inventions include <gb> , for example , <ge> the cash point , pay card , financial swap , bar code , and floppy disc .
<gb> &quot; <ge> if your business is defined by movement forward <gb> , <ge> you cannot be emotionally attached to the past <gb> , &apos; says Samuel J. Palmisano <ge> .
<gb> that is why <ge> IBM easily builds its foundations on many platforms <gb> - if they do not work , it leaves them <ge> .
this is how it differs from <gb> , for example , <ge> its competitor <gb> , Microsoft , which basically stands and falls on Windows , its operating system <ge> .
since 2000 , IBM has sold low profitable assets <gb> worth 15 billion dollars <ge> . during the same time , it has invested 58 billion dollars <gb> into purchasing of perspective technologies <ge> .
IBM follows the legacy of its first director <gb> , Thomas J. Watson , <ge> who increased the amount of investments <gb> during the Great Depression <ge> .
since the beginning of 2008 , the price <gb> of IBM &apos;s shares <ge> has grown by remarkable 120 per cent <gb> ; company &apos;s net earnings have been growing continuously <ge> .
it took the name of IBM in 1924 <gb> . originally , this was <ge> a brand used for company &apos;s branches in Canada and South America .
foundations <gb> for the later IBM <ge> were laid by a merger of four companies <gb> , the history of which goes back to the 1880s <ge> .
<gb> the architect of the new company was a businessman , <ge> Charles Ranlett Flint <gb> , who , <ge> until 1930 <gb> , also <ge> presided over the company &apos;s Board of Trustees .
Flint hired a director <gb> of a competing company , Thomas J. Watson , <ge> to help him with company management .
the leader then put the IBM &apos;s founder in the shade <gb> - Watson &apos;s ideas remain the base for invincible company culture and identity <ge> .
IBM <gb> , as its name suggests , <ge> started by producing and selling various business machines <gb> - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers <ge> .
<gb> during the first four years of Watson &apos;s leadership , <ge> the revenue doubled to nine million dollars <gb> , and company &apos;s vast expansion into all continents commenced <ge> .
Watson became so essential for the company <gb> , <ge> that <gb> after nearly forty years , <ge> his position <gb> in the director &apos;s chair <ge> was taken by his son <gb> , Thomas Watson Junior <ge> .
in 1960s , both people and computers from IBM helped <gb> NASA control space flights - to Mercury , Saturn , and in 1969 , <ge> man &apos;s flight to the Moon .
the classic PC <gb> that defined the computer standards of the period , called IBM 5150 , <ge> came to the market in 1981 .
twenty years later , IBM sold computer production <gb> to a Chinese company , Lenovo , <ge> While buying the consultant division <gb> of PricewaterhouseCoopers , and thus commenced its full focus on consulting and high added value services <ge> .
its goal is both smart exploitation of technologies <gb> in areas that have not yet been planned for <ge> and improving the situation in traffic <gb> or town management <ge> .
for commerce , IBM has recently introduced a smarter Commerce platform <gb> that helps businessmen control the whole commerce cycle <ge> .
in former Czechoslovakia , <gb> as the first country in both Central and Eastern Europe , <ge> IBM founded its branch in 1932 .
the headquarters <gb> for both Central and Eastern Europe <ge> resides in Prague <gb> , where there also is a world level research team focusing on voice recognition <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> she does not want to wait any longer <gb> , and set clear rules for her future life <ge> .
even though she had Iveta move out of <gb> Říčany 30 days later , Pepa would not leave the singer . <ge>
after some time , Darina <gb> resigned , <ge> pretended to accept her husband &apos;s affair <gb> ; and now she gave him her final goodbye <ge> .
<gb> even if one day Rychtář and Bartošová would split up , <ge> his wife will not welcome him <gb> with open arms <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> he is the biological father to my sons <gb> and if he wants to spend his last days in our house <ge> , no one will chase him out . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; our company still operates ; <ge> I am in charge of repairs <gb> , garden , the house , <ge> and shopping . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> Darina and I communicate in a completely normal way <gb> , only we do not share our bed anymore , &quot; Rychtář said for Blesk <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we don &apos;t sleep together , and I don &apos;t care <gb> where she goes , with whom , and <ge> if she has a boyfriend .
I know it &apos;s my fault <gb> , I fell in love with Iveta , <ge> and I accept full responsibility <gb> , &quot; Josef concluded <ge> .
<gb> still , <ge> who of you could resist <gb> walking through clothes shops <ge> looking for well fitting clothes and then trying them all <gb> ( ideally , in various colour versions ) in the changing rooms <ge> ?
<gb> not that you should stop looking after yourself , but <ge> many men are literary allergic to their partners <gb> &quot; constant complaints about their looks <ge> .
<gb> the stronger sex also agrees that <ge> the higher the frequency of such complaints , the more annoying women are .
cleaning the windows , vacuuming , wiping the floors , dusting , scrubbing the bathtub <gb> - at least twice a week <ge> .
in case you suffer from this <gb> &quot; <ge> deviation , <gb> &quot; <ge> try to realise that <gb> no extremes are good ; and that within your family , <ge> order <gb> and cleanliness <ge> should not go first .
women are focused on relationships <gb> , which is why they like to discuss who , where , who with , how , and why <ge> .
<gb> however , there are tougher gossips , women who enjoy frequent gossiping and despise everyone . <ge> they are <gb> , especially within a female work team , <ge> very dangerous for their surroundings .
<gb> in both cases , Claude Giroux , used the experience of a thirty-nine year old star ; <ge> he added an extra pass and was announced best player of the match .
<gb> &quot; you sometimes feel such things , &quot; explained Jágr , after whose action <ge> Giroux scored a goal on the first Flyers <gb> &quot; shot <ge> .
a second before the first break , a home player <gb> , Patrick Dwyer , <ge> narrowed the lead in a power-play <gb> , but the beginning of the second part was led by Flyers again <ge> .
after assist with Jágr <gb> , he scored the third goal ; consequently , <ge> his shot was touched into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds .
<gb> &quot; I don &apos;t ; want to say he &apos;s the best league player , <ge> but he &apos;s definitely among the best three <gb> , &quot; said Jágr , complimenting his center <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I never thought <gb> that at the end of my career <ge> I would play with a hockey player like him . <gb> &quot; <ge>
Carolina made the match more dramatic <gb> with Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyer &apos;s goal from a penalty shot <ge> , making it a single goal difference .
<gb> &quot; <ge> he poked out the puck <gb> , I gained speed , and Read went on to the more distant pole <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> I aimed at him , and I &apos;m glad it worked <gb> , &quot; Voráček described his view of the last goal of the match <ge> .
<gb> Czech Montreal defenseman , Jaroslav <ge> Špaček <gb> , <ge> did not finish the match with Buffalo <gb> ; he left in the second period due to an upper body injury <ge> .
<gb> along with the experienced back , <ge> the Candiens lost their two-goal lead and lost 2 : 3 after a penalty shoot-out .
<gb> more than lost points , <ge> the home trainer was sorry for high sick rate in the back <gb> , as the match was finished with just five defenders <ge> .
<gb> &quot; however , <ge> there is nothing we can do about that <gb> , we just have to face it , &quot; Jacques Martin said <ge> .
<gb> until 1989 , only <ge> five state travel agencies were allowed in the former Czechoslovakia <gb> : Čedok , Sporturist , CKM , Rekrea , and Autoturist <ge> .
<gb> a great paradox of the socialistic period was that <ge> citizens of the socialist block ( i.e. Czechoslovaks too ) were not allowed free individual travel within the socialist countries .
if a <gb> Czechoslovak <ge> citizen wanted to travel , <gb> as an individual , to , for example , the Soviet Union or Poland , <ge> an invitation letter from the country was necessary <gb> ; otherwise , individual travel was impossible <ge> .
<gb> at the time , <ge> travel agencies would offer some trips to the West <gb> , but one either had to stand in a line overnight , with a sleeping bag or have some &quot; good friends &quot; in the agency <ge> .
a foreign currency assurance was essential for travels to the West . <gb> it was not granted to politically unreliable people , who were not allowed to travel at all . <ge>
<gb> most often , <ge> Czechs spent their holiday at home <gb> , which resulted in great number of cottages and summer houses , a habit that survives until now <ge> .
<gb> while until 1989 , a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the climax of our travels , <ge> last year , Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays <gb> in countries all over the world <ge> .
right at the beginning of 1990 , visa requirements <gb> for neighbouring West European countries <ge> were cancelled . <gb> this started a huge wave of short-term visits of chiefly Vienna and Germany . <ge>
Czechoslovaks could not get enough of travelling to the West . <gb> everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment . <ge>
another important moment was the introduction of freely convertible Czech Crown . <gb> after decades , our tourists thus finally able to freely buy Western currencies . <ge>
since 1997 , increased demand allowed travel agencies to prepare regular trips <gb> by charter airlines . compared to the past , air trips thus became unbelievably cheap due to the ability to order quantity discounts <ge> .
by the end of 1990s , Czechs did not need visa for visiting <gb> nearly all <ge> developed world countries <gb> , except for the USA . this made our travelling even easier <ge> .
the next significant event in the history <gb> of after revolution travelling <ge> came in 2000 . <gb> high demand resulted in the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country , Thailand . <ge>
<gb> since then , <ge> direct charter flights take Czech tourists to warm exotic countries . <gb> this winter , flights from the Czech Republic will reach twelve exotic destinations . <ge>
<gb> on November 17 , 2008 , the USA removed visa requirements for Czech tourists . <ge> our country has <gb> thus permanently <ge> joined the world &apos;s most developed countries .
<gb> Hašek resigned from his function in June . when leaving , he called to his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future . <ge>
general meeting delegates wasted their trip to the National House <gb> in Prague , Smíchov , as the negotiations remained blocked , not just regarding the election method <ge> .
no agreement was reached as to who is entitled to vote at the general meeting <gb> - whether the statutory representatives only , or also officials given power of attorney <ge> .
this single point has been partially settled since <gb> , thanks to a recommendation of the Institute of State and Law , according to which representation based on power of attorney is not possible <ge> .
the Executive Board has not been of much help <gb> either <ge> , though <gb> at its meetings , both regular and extraordinary , <ge> it is mostly preoccupied by this issue .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the argument is based on whether to follow the by-laws or to find another model <gb> , &quot; says one of the three FAČR Vice-Presidents , Dušan Svoboda , who represents professional football in the association &apos;s management <ge> .
based on the model given by the by-laws , the winner <gb> of the 3rd round <ge> is a candidate with higher percentage support from the chamber <gb> he is the candidate for <ge> .
<gb> somewhat surprisingly Tomáš Paclík agrees with his opinion even if it is estimated that <ge> the election rules defined by the by-laws fits Pelta best of the candidates .
he <gb> believes the new President will be known in Nymburk ; he also <ge> hopes that <gb> in the future , <ge> the candidates will cooperate constructively .
<gb> &quot; it is not between people from Bohemia and Moravia , but <ge> there are attempts at purposeful adjustment of regulations . <gb> &quot; <ge>
some negotiations are said to have taken place directly in Montenegro <gb> ; but who knows if the football generality will be complete before the match <ge> .
a lot is in the game <gb> : government grants ; football trustworthiness ; and the planned ČSTV general meeting dealing with new direction of Czech sports following Sazka &apos;s financial problems <ge> .
<gb> &quot; if there was a good quality candidate , <ge> I &apos;d fight for him and not participate in the fight . <gb> &quot; <ge>
Paclík &apos;s motivation <gb> to join the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl <ge> is to try to prevent Pelta <gb> , reportedly the favourite of the elections , <ge> from entering the top of the FAČR .
moreover , Paclík emphasizes that <gb> should he win , <ge> he would only remain the President until 2013 <gb> , when a regular general meeting is scheduled <ge> .
<gb> in the future , <ge> he would like to see the position given to an experienced top manager <gb> , not excessively connected to football life <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I was terrible for me to hear some of them say that <gb> at this point , <ge> they don &apos;t <gb> even <ge> want to identify themselves with <gb> Czech <ge> football . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; combined with support from Berbr , a capable businessman , <ge> this would be even more harmful for the football <gb> , &quot; Paclík said <ge> .
this opinion is shared by another candidate <gb> , Rajchl , whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting that ended as a fiasco <ge> .
one of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations <gb> between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee , with whose support he would lobby at the political top to get more money for sports from the lottery tax <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> if taxes are imposed on gambling , <gb> as the political parties declare , I understand their arguments , but <ge> they must clearly say where the money will go <gb> , &quot; he said <ge> .
before the Thursday negotiations <gb> in Nymburk <ge> , a Jablonec functionary remains an optimist <gb> and believes that the pre-election fight would be significantly suppressed by today &apos;s prospective success of our football representation <ge> .
prior to the <gb> failed <ge> election <gb> in September <ge> , Pelta promised <gb> that if he was to win , <ge> he would focus on <gb> both the representation and <ge> gaining of financial means .
<gb> &quot; <ge> people at all levels have been in football for long <gb> , and they expect the President to be known on Thursday <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; they feel it &apos;s high time someone leads the association , &quot; claims the man chiefly connected with the Jablonec club ; <ge> but he spent many years in <gb> Sparta and <ge> the association &apos;s executive board .
he believes current problems with elections are caused by the euphoria <gb> there was in the time of Ivan Hašek &apos;s reign <ge> .
<gb> &quot; unfortunately , <ge> regulations that were not as perfect as we all thought were passed at the general meeting in June . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; if various representations were not accepted , <ge> we would have had a President since September <gb> , &quot; Pelta said <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> if I become President <gb> , I will take it as my personal task , and <ge> I &apos;m willing to take personal responsibility in case the attempt fails . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; however , his attacks were not decent , and <ge> many people were caught by surprise by the method of his election campaign . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> this is <gb> too , is <ge> why some of them now doubt his true character <gb> , &quot; Pelta said about his rival . Pelta himself claims to be true to the proclamations he announced in September <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> í would also try to end all affairs <gb> , starting from the Bohemians case or the aftermath of last year &apos;s corruption scandal <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> right after that , I would focus on negotiations <gb> with both private and state sectors , <ge> to ensure enough money for the whole football <gb> , &quot; the forty-six year old candidate told ČTK two months ago <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I &apos;d need to learn about the job descriptions of individual employees . <gb> &quot; that was his message for Strahov , where the long period of interregnum causes understandable nervousness . <ge>
<gb> despite current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the general meeting planned , <ge> he believes that <gb> on Thursday , <ge> the delegates will not come to Nymburk in vain .
<gb> &quot; if the only questionable point is how <ge> to perform the elections in the third round <gb> that <ge> is something we can get over . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> football needs trustworthiness <gb> it can only gain by finally having its leader <ge> , <gb> &quot; <ge> says Pelta <gb> , who , two days before the crucial day of his career of a functionary , remains an optimist <ge> .
he also promised to <gb> solve the Bohemians case ; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA ; bring more money to football ; and <ge> continue the work of the previous President <gb> , Ivan Hašek <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA <gb> , to representation , professional football , and performance football for the youth <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> I &apos;m a team player <gb> , and I want to distribute the competences within the executive board so that each member focuses on a certain area <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &apos; <ge> I &apos;ll distribute tasks strictly so that <gb> in each of these segments , <ge> football makes big steps forward . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> that would probably not please many people <gb> , as it would mean hard work , not just criticizing of the work of others , &quot; he added <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I believe in systematic approach <gb> , which is something I don &apos;t think Mirek Pelta is competent of <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> I want to make football for everyone , <gb> because then everyone has a good time , <ge> not just the chosen few <gb> , &quot; Rajchl said <ge> .
<gb> &quot; though some people try to claim the opposite , <ge> I plan to do the maximum for Moravia . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; for example , <ge> it is high time to consider about splitting the second league <gb> into Czech and Moravian parts , winners of which would continue into the first league <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> this would prevent the current situation <gb> , where there are just three Moravian units in the league , <ge> which is a problem concerning young players <gb> in Moravia , &quot; Rajchl said <ge> .
<gb> as the Presidential fight has been joined by Pilsen club Manager , Tomáš Paclík , <ge> Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances to win .
<gb> on the other hand , he considers the fact that <ge> the association does not stick together partially as his own fault .
<gb> paddling pools with universal fibre optics and status pools in Budapest . <ge> travellers can experience Europe &apos;s incredible water <gb> - <ge> and relax <gb> tired limbs <ge> in a Jacuzzi <gb> after a city tour or a ramble <ge> .
there was one thing Iris Meder could not do without <gb> on research trips over the last one and a half years <ge> : her swimming costume .
she rushed to add any pool she liked to her notebook <gb> - with essential details on the construction and the history of the building <ge> .
she has very little enthusiasm for sport <gb> , says Meder - but in the water , it &apos;s a different matter <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> one day , I asked myself why swimming baths always have to be so ugly <gb> , &quot; says Vienna-based Meder <ge> .
<gb> splashing in the diving pool and ethereal sauna oils - <ge> the wellness factor in baths is <gb> so <ge> great because all the senses are stimulated <gb> , according to Meder <ge> .
<gb> and <ge> swimming baths can be a real treat for the eyes <gb> if the builders have gone to the trouble . &quot; you have the surface of the water in pools instead of a floor <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the illustrated pocketbook <gb> The joys of Bathing <ge> provides valuable information on the <gb> architectural and <ge> cultural history <gb> of historic pleasure and health oases over 190 pages - and makes you want to leap into the water <ge> .
<gb> perhaps the <ge> most unusual pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld . the Aqua Dome in Ötztal looks like a UFO <gb> has just <ge> landed in the Alps .
<gb> a lot of thermal baths smell of sulphur . <ge> the Árpád baths <gb> in Békescsaba , Hungary , <ge> smell so strongly of oil you may find it difficult to believe you are in a health spa .
Iris Meder <gb> , however , <ge> was <gb> at one point <ge> disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places . <gb> when she tried to visit the outdoor pool at the Czech baths of Luhatschowitz , she found the area sealed off . <ge>
when Meder looked through the weather-beaten windows <gb> of the red , white and yellow art nouveau building <ge> , she could see weeds growing up through the tiles .
<gb> one place where <ge> decay has been stopped in <gb> its tracks is a magical swimming bath in <ge> the Black Forest <gb> - the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad <ge> .
<gb> the baths have already gone through three stages of construction . <ge> you will not only discover neo-Romanesque elements <gb> from the period after it was built in 1844 , <ge> but also a Moorish hall <gb> in Alhambra style added around 1900 <ge> .
according to SPIEGEL ONLINE , Josef Ackermann has given a working group the task of investigating the consequences <gb> of speculation for the poor around the world <ge> .
<gb> for German citizens the situation is clear . <ge> according to one study , 84 percent <gb> of Germans <ge> find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural commodities <gb> such as wheat and maize <ge> .
two thirds <gb> of those questioned <ge> demand that <gb> Deutsche Bank and <ge> other banks cease trading in agricultural commodities <gb> , as trading deepens the problems faced by the very poorest people around the world <ge> .
the findings were made in a survey conducted <gb> by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis <ge> on behalf of the consumer organisation <gb> Foodwatch <ge> .
<gb> the author of the report , <ge> Harald Schumann , shows that betting on global commodities exchanges drives up prices <gb> - and the banks are therefore complicit in global hunger <ge> .
the campaign <gb> by consumer advocates <ge> is directed specifically at the head of Deutsche Bank <gb> , Josef Ackermann , although large banking houses such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade in the same way <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> most experts now agree that the gamblers have left behind the rules of supply and demand <gb> - and are profiting at the expense of the poorest <ge> .
<gb> in contrast to US competitors , Ackermann has responded to the criticism . <ge> he has promised to investigate the accusations <gb> and has said that no trade is &quot; worth putting Deutsche Bank &apos;s good reputation at risk <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> according to SPIEGEL ONLINE , <ge> an international working group is currently investigating the accusations contained in the Foodwatch report .
the investigation should be complete by the end of the year <gb> when the findings will be presented to Deutsche Bank &apos;s board of managing directors - with recommendations for action <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio <gb> that bet money on food prices , &quot; said Bode <ge> .
Ackermann &apos;s <gb> sensitive <ge> response is at first surprising , but <gb> then <ge> the CEO would like to present a perfect image <gb> just a few months before the end of his term in office <ge> .
<gb> bode published the survey on Tuesday . <ge> the survey was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research <gb> and Statistical Analysis on 7 and 8 November and 1001 people took part <ge> .
<gb> no more than eleven percent think <ge> it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments <gb> that bet on the price of foodstuffs <ge> .
many banking customers would <gb> also <ge> take direct action if <gb> they discover that <ge> their bank is involved in such trading . <gb> according to the survey , one in two would withdraw investments that end up in commodities speculation . <ge>
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank <gb> , 49 percent said they would think about closing their account and switching to a different bank <ge> .
it made the architect so famous that he also built Austria &apos;s pavilion <gb> at the next world &apos;s fair <ge> .
he finally shot to fame internationally <gb> in 1973 <ge> with his <gb> legendary <ge> four-cylinder BMW Tower <gb> and its bowl-shaped sister building <ge> .
<gb> however , <ge> the building was not suitable <gb> as a museum for technical and spatial reasons <ge> - it had no walls to hang artworks and poor air conditioning .
the architect <gb> Adolf Krischanitz <ge> has now renovated the pavilion <gb> , which has been named the &quot; 21er Haus &quot; and will be used as a contemporary art museum <ge> .
the museum is a branch of the Belvedere museum <gb> , which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening - a delight in every respect <ge> .
Agnes Husslein-Arco <gb> who became the new director of the Austrian Galerie Belvedere in 2007 <ge> was instrumental in the new beginning .
he knew the <gb> original design and knew the <ge> issues the building was facing <gb> , a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was relocated to Vienna and converted <ge> .
the problems facing the latest alterations were much greater . the building was &quot; an energy guzzler <gb> , <ge> &quot; <gb> says Krischanitz <ge> .
the window profiles <gb> of the glass facade <ge> were replaced <gb> , fibreglass-reinforced safety glass was put in <ge> and the glass roof was replaced by <gb> high-grade <ge> safety glass .
<gb> the original external doors have been retained and <ge> the building has been painted in the old red-brown colour <gb> of rust-proofing <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we often had to find a material that <gb> was good , cheap and <ge> met with the approval of the monument authority <gb> , &quot; says Krischanitz , pointing to the rough flooring in the basement <ge> .
Krischanitz stated <gb> recently <ge> that the pavilion <gb> &quot; from Brussels &quot; <ge> had been tough <gb> - a typical &quot; <ge> drop in the city <gb> &quot; <ge> story .
architecture <gb> like this is &quot; always in the wrong place &quot; and nonetheless <ge> wants to <gb> &quot; <ge> stimulate a real awareness . <gb> &quot; <ge>
according to a newspaper report , Deutsche Bahn will spend <gb> more than <ge> 70 million Euros more <gb> this year <ge> in the battle to prevent <gb> winter-time cancellations and <ge> delays .
investment is intended to improve the availability of <gb> locomotives and <ge> the rail network <gb> , even in the face of extreme weather conditions <ge> .
the number of <gb> internal and <ge> external employees involved in removing snow <gb> from rail facilities and platforms <ge> is to double to 16,000 .
the aim is to clear platforms of snow and <gb> ice by start of business and <ge> 90 percent of the critical points <gb> within four to five hours <ge> .
Rüdiger Grube <gb> , head of Deutsche Bahn , <ge> warned of train cancellations and delays this winter at a summit with government and industry <gb> two months ago <ge> .
<gb> last winter , <ge> Deutsche Bahn had considerable difficulties in its passenger business <gb> , as it lacked reserves in the face of difficult weather conditions <ge> .
<gb> fresh trouble is following hard on the heels of the uproar around Josef Ackermann , CEO of Deutsche Bank : <ge> Deutsche Bank faces a multi-million pound fine in the USA .
<gb> the National Credit Union Administration ( <ge> NCUA <gb> ) , a financial market regulator , <ge> accuses a string of major banks of having used false promises to mislead credit unions <gb> into buying the financial products <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we are happy to have resolved the issue without the parties going to court <gb> , &quot; said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in new York <ge> .
the National Credit Union Administration ( NCUA ) is responsible for the US credit unions <gb> and intervenes in bankruptcies to protect customer deposits <ge> .
the US investment bank <gb> , Lehman Brothers , <ge> went belly up in September 2008 <gb> at the height of the financial crisis <ge> .
it accuses 18 major international banks of having taken in US lenders <gb> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac <ge> on mortgage transactions <gb> valued at around 200 billion dollars <ge> .
Deutsche Bank also faces legal action by the FHFA covering multiple transactions <gb> with a total value of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007 <ge> .
the regulator is demanding that the <gb> Frankfurt-based <ge> bank take responsibility for <gb> &quot; substantial <ge> losses <gb> , &quot; but has not yet specified the exact sum <ge> .
until now , <gb> the major American investor , <ge> Warren Buffett <gb> , <ge> had always claimed not to invest in <gb> IT and <ge> computing companies <gb> , as it was difficult to forecast the long-term development <ge> .
<gb> according to Buffett , he should have realised much earlier that <ge> IBM <gb> primarily offers services and <ge> purchases computer systems for the IT departments <gb> of other companies <ge> .
Buffett <gb> revealed that he <ge> had purchased IBM shares totalling 10.7 billion dollars <gb> since March on the US business news broadcaster CNBC <ge> .
his investment holding company <gb> , Berkshire Hathaway , <ge> has become one of the largest shareholders <gb> in IBM with a 5.5 percent stake <ge> .
the computer pioneer <gb> - now more than 100 years old - also <ge> provides software and consultancy services <gb> , as well as powerful business computers <ge> .
his holding company <gb> , Berkshire Hathaway , <ge> owns shares in a long list of major companies <gb> such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re ( formerly Münchener Rück ) alongside around 80 of its own subsidiaries <ge> .
the 81-year-old <gb> took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and <ge> built it up <gb> , with clever investments , <ge> into one of the most valuable companies in the world .
his <gb> almost infallible <ge> instinct for making money has earned him a nickname <gb> as the &quot; <ge> Oracle from Omaha . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the IBM share price rose by one percent before the markets opened <gb> following the announcement of Buffett &apos;s investment <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> big Blue <gb> , &quot; as IBM is also known , <ge> is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange <gb> , making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world alongside Apple and Microsoft <ge> .
<gb> following the discovery of the &quot; Zwickau cell , &quot; Turkish <ge> media express doubt about the rule of law in Germany .
the murder <gb> of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 <ge> was the result of <gb> right-wing <ge> extremist ideology .
fear and concern has been the reaction to this report <gb> in Turkey and within the German-Turkish community in Germany <ge> .
the <gb> right-wing <ge> extremist network <gb> that has now been discovered , however , <ge> is on a scale that has not yet been fully understood .
<gb> &quot; <ge> is this a revival of the bloody ideology <gb> ? &quot; was the headline of the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk <ge> .
the Turkish Community of Germany <gb> ( TGD ) <ge> reacted calmly , remembering the victims <gb> of racial violence <ge> during a silent vigil <gb> in front of the Brandenburg Gate at the weekend <ge> .
just two weeks earlier , the Turkish Community <gb> in Berlin <ge> had commemorated the <gb> fiftieth <ge> anniversary of the <gb> German-Turkish <ge> bilateral agreement <gb> on labour recruitment in a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians <ge> .
he points out that people have been murdered <gb> who had paid taxes and made an important contribution to Germany &apos;s redevelopment with their work <ge> .
the authors are asking themselves why the German authorities did not <gb> think earlier to <ge> look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles .
some writers even go as far as some strong rhetoric . <gb> &quot; if things continue to be done so cack-handedly , migrants have no option but armed self-defence . &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> peace in Germany depends very strongly on how the entire network is uncovered <gb> and on the appropriateness of punishment , &quot; writes &quot; Selen <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the attacks <gb> on Mölln and Solingen in the 90s <ge> are an example of what it means for peace <gb> in Germany <ge> to be at risk .
the coverage by the Turkish media <gb> at the time again <ge> shows how deep the mistrust of <gb> many <ge> German Turks in the current German state has become since .
straight talking is what is needed now , alongside efforts to <gb> identify and <ge> reassess <gb> right-wing <ge> extremist terrorism <gb> in Germany <ge> .
UBS almost went bankrupt <gb> during the financial crisis <ge> and has been struggling <gb> from one crisis to the next <ge> ever since .
Axel Weber was <gb> clearly <ge> delighted <gb> , praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly won solidity and making some friendly remarks about his future colleagues <ge> .
a UBS trader <gb> in London <ge> had bypassed all the bank &apos;s security systems and gambled away <gb> around <ge> 1.7 billion Euros .
<gb> and <ge> he will take on the role of Chairman of the Board <gb> in May , and not in 2013 <ge> , the bank announced on Tuesday .
he is an economics professor and central banker <gb> , not a conventional banker , and clearly would need some time to adjust <ge> .
all at once , he is taking on responsibility for the strategy of a bank <gb> that has once again proven that it has long deserved the title of &quot; Europe &apos;s biggest banking scandal <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the bank combined the image of the secretive and solid <gb> , but equally savvy asset manager with ambitious targets , <ge> aiming to become a major player in investment banking .
as a result , in 2007 UBS was managing 1.6 billion , <gb> thereby managing more more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world , <ge>
<gb> in the middle of the year , CEO <ge> Peter Wuffli - considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker <gb> - suddenly stepped down <ge> .
UBS announced a capital increase <gb> , believe it or not , of 13 billion Swiss francs to face the crisis <ge> .
the bank was forced to announce new losses <gb> running into the billions <ge> and <gb> Chairman of the Board of Directors , <ge> Marcel Ospel <gb> - the second best paid chairman in Switzerland in 2006 - <ge> resigned .
<gb> catastrophe followed in October 2008 . <ge> UBS faced collapse from a lack of investment during the financial crisis <gb> and had to be saved by the state <ge> .
<gb> the National Bank bought up toxic securities from UBS for untold billions and <ge> the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs <gb> for a mandatory convertible bond <ge> to become part owner of the bank .
<gb> the whole of <ge> Switzerland <gb> was shocked - the country <ge> recognised the dramatic consequences for a small country of being home to such large banks .
<gb> after all , <ge> the balance sheet total for UBS in 2007 was more than five times the economic output of Switzerland ( see chart ) .
UBS also agreed to pay 780 million dollars <gb> consisting of repayment of unjustified profits from the business and a penalty <ge> .
<gb> at the same time , <ge> UBS lost something that had always been its advantage <gb> when competing for rich clients - the fog of secrecy <ge> .
the bank had lost its credibility in both of its core business divisions <gb> within a few months - in investment banking thanks to bad speculation and in asset management by aiding and abetting tax evasion <ge> .
<gb> the CFO of one major German bank also has no doubts : &quot; <ge> the problem facing UBS is that it does not having a handle on risk control . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the safes of Swiss banks had become a symbol of <gb> unshakeable <ge> reliability <gb> , just as Lindt and Sprüngli had come to symbolise sophisticated chocolate <ge> .
the bank has its head office on Zurich &apos;s Bahnhofstrasse <gb> that leads from the main station directly to Zurich Lake <ge> , surrounded by the <gb> snow-capped <ge> peaks of the Swiss mountains .
the Swiss banks have resided here for hundreds of years <gb> - from the National Bank to the palace of Credit Suisse and elite private banks such as Julius Bär <ge> .
the walls within are clad in marble behind vast leather armchairs . <gb> there is a large sign to the &quot; Safe &quot; next to the bank &apos;s logo . <ge>
but both the major Swiss banks <gb> , UBS and Credit Suisse , at some point <ge> ousted the Swiss banking concept <gb> - or betrayed it , as the head of one small Swiss private bank believes <ge> .
he would prefer not to see his name in the newspaper <gb> - he too , like all Swiss bankers , does business with the two major banks <ge> .
he believes UBS has grown too big <gb> - particularly in investment banking where the Anglo-Saxons are also very active <ge> .
the politicians approved up to 68 billion Swiss francs <gb> ( around 45 billion Euros ) to save the bank from bankruptcy <ge> .
a bank was created <gb> that was already too big for small Switzerland <ge> when the merger was agreed <gb> - and a bank that continued to grow <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team <gb> , &quot; says the banking research , Hans Geiger <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> Wuffli , <gb> highly intellectual , modest , <ge> with a deep understanding of models <gb> and statistics <ge> , and Ospel , with gut instinct <gb> who had worked his way up from being a banker &apos;s apprentice <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> and <ge> Wuffli ultimately may have made a critical error . <gb> &quot; he thought his models were reality , &quot; says Geiger . <ge>
employees of UBS <gb> clearly <ge> remember the management meetings where <gb> CEO <ge> Wuffli <gb> always <ge> repeated the same slogan <gb> - dethrone Goldman Sachs <ge> .
hungry for growth , the bank itself <gb> and a hedge fund founded by the bank <ge> invested in US subprime securities .
it developed into a vast machine that packaged up securities based on US mortgage credit <gb> and passed them on - while itself continuing to bear risks <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> UBS was buying <gb> as late as the summer of 2007 <ge> when the US housing market was in flames <gb> , &quot; says banking expert Geiger <ge> .
<gb> one manager after the next had to go as the <ge> attempts to clean up proved more difficult than anticipated .
<gb> banking expert Geiger already has an idea - <ge> quit investment banking <gb> , focus on asset management <ge> and turn back to Swiss roots .
the new head of the bank <gb> , Sergio Ermotti , <ge> plans to present his future strategy <gb> to the world on Tuesday <ge> .
<gb> the 51-year-old <ge> Italo-Swiss banker was actually only imagined as a transitional solution <gb> when the bank parted ways unexpectedly with his predecessor Grübel <ge> .
<gb> since then , <ge> he <gb> has proved his mettle and <ge> is now to head UBS permanently <gb> , the Zurich-based bank announced on Tuesday <ge> .
publicly , he has only so far that he <gb> and his wife <ge> will look for a flat <gb> in Zurich <ge> .
the <gb> Italian and Greek <ge> glass was still considered half full last week , <gb> not half empty - <ge> now the problems are coming to the fore <gb> once again , said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott <ge> .
industry in the 17 Euro countries has <gb> significantly <ge> reduced production and is adjusting to the end of the upturn .
the Eurostat statistics office announced that <gb> , in September , <ge> companies produced two percent less <gb> than in the previous month <ge> .
<gb> the announcement made US investors sceptical . &quot; <ge> we are not an island . we are dependent <gb> , &quot; said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management <ge> .
his investment <gb> of more than ten billion dollars in IBM <ge> boosted the veteran company &apos;s share price <gb> by almost one percent against the trend during the course of trading <ge> .
the bank is converting almost all its remaining shares <gb> in the China Construction Bank <ge> into cash <gb> , bringing in 6.6 billion dollars <ge> .
the Emirates airline ordered 50 <gb> long-range type 777 <ge> aeroplanes <gb> on Sunday with an order value of 18 billion dollars <ge> .
<gb> Rooks are considered problem birds in many places . <ge> experts now say the <gb> highly intelligent <ge> animals can no longer be driven from cities .
experts <gb> at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian town of Leer <ge> have said that rooks can no longer be forced out of cities .
conservationists stated that migration <gb> of specially protected rooks <ge> was the root of the problem in cities <gb> , pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats <ge> .
there are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs <gb> in the Westphalian town of Soest and in the north-west in Jever , Diepholz , Achim bei Bremen and Leer <ge> .
spraying off nests with water or felling trees <gb> often <ge> has undesired consequences <gb> , said environment expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg <ge> .
<gb> without the surrounding area , <ge> the problem in the cities will not be solved <gb> , said Leer &apos;s mayor , Wolfgang Kellner <ge> .
<gb> a combination of <ge> deterring birds from sensitive residential areas and offering incentives for them to move back to other areas would be an option .
Jürgens was a co-founder of the <gb> Ascherberg crow educational <ge> trail in Schleswig-Holstein <gb> , where notice boards provide information about the life of the highly intelligent rook <ge> .
Jürgens also expressed her opinion on the criticism of the noise the birds make . <gb> &quot; the noise conveys a lot of information . they have a lot to say to each other . &quot; <ge>
the intelligence and skill of the birds are legendary . <gb> Rooks often do not just use tools to get hold of a choice morsel , but create tools themselves . <ge>
<gb> in one experiment , <ge> the birds quickly learnt that they had to knock over a platform to get to a moth larva .
all four birds used the <gb> wire to form a hook and used the <ge> hook to fish the bucket out of the tube <gb> by its handle <ge> .
<gb> the favourites <ge> Portugal , Croatia and the Czech Republic , plus Ireland , will be at the 2012 European championship .
led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo <gb> who scored in the 8th and 53rd minutes <ge> , Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6 : 2 <gb> ( 2 : 1 ) , rounding off their fifth Euro appearance perfectly after 0 : 0 in the first leg <ge> .
the Czechs only needed 1 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) in the playoff second leg against outsider Montenegro <gb> after a clear win in the first leg ( 2 : 0 ) <ge> .
Croatia did not miss a trick with 0 : 0 against Turkey <gb> and Ireland managed an easy 1 : 1 ( 1 : 0 ) against Estonia <ge> .
Nani <gb> ( 24th minute ) <ge> , Helder Postiga <gb> ( 72nd and 82nd ) <ge> and Miguel Veloso <gb> ( 80th ) <ge> scored the other goals <gb> for Portugal <ge> .
the former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic and captain Emir Spahic evened the score <gb> with a converted 41st-minute penalty and a goal in the 65th for Bosnia <ge> .
a good quarter of an hour later , Nani displayed his long-range abilities <gb> , raising the lead to 2 : 0 from the 25 metre line <ge> .
following an attack on <gb> Helder <ge> Postiga <gb> in the Bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute <ge> , Stark decided the <gb> Portuguese <ge> player had simulated <gb> and gave him a yellow card <ge> .
luck also smiled on <gb> trainer Michal <ge> Bilek &apos;s team and Bundesliga legionaries <gb> Michael Kadlec ( Bayer Leverkusen ) and Tomas Pekhart ( 1st FC Nuremberg ) with a potentially catastrophic error early on <ge> .
goalie Petr Cech prevented a potential own goal <gb> from Tomas Sivok in the 9th minute with a split-second reflex <ge> .
Damjanovic took a shot from the edge of the penalty area <gb> that just missed Cech &apos;s goal in the 40th minute <ge> .
<gb> trainer Giovanni <ge> Trapattoni &apos;s team <gb> - already looking assured of a place following the 4 : 0 victory in the first leg - <ge> took the lead in the <gb> 32nd minute thanks to a goal from Stephen Ward . <ge>
Ireland kept up the pace , but had to wait until the 23rd minute <gb> when Robbie Keane from Los Angeles had the first clean shot on goal <ge> .
<gb> the police announced in a statement that <ge> he had threatened a 25-year-old employee with a firearm <gb> and demanded money be handed over <ge> .
after the cash draw <gb> was handed over <ge> , the robber fled <gb> unrecognised and with an unknown amount of money <ge> .
he attempted to swerve out of the way of a van <gb> with trailer <ge> that shot out onto the road <gb> from a petrol station <ge> .
a 61-year-old female cyclist was <gb> knocked down and <ge> seriously injured by a car in Berlin-Mitte on Monday .

a <gb> 46-year-old <ge> male cyclist was knocked down and <gb> seriously <ge> injured by a car in Berlin-Kreuzberg <gb> late on Sunday evening <ge> .
<gb> the police announced in a statement on Monday that <ge> he had been taken to hospital with head injuries <gb> and could not be questioned <ge> .
the cause of the collision <gb> with the vehicle driven by a 22-year-old man <ge> is not yet clear .
<gb> the police announced in a statement that <ge> the man had skidded on Möllendorfstrasse , crashed into a tramway pylon and had landed on the trackbed .
the fire brigade was informed and had to free a seriously injured 23-year-old <gb> from the car wreck and take him to hospital <ge> .

the men <gb> then followed him , <ge> punched and kicked their <gb> unsuspecting <ge> victim and fled with his wallet and mobile .
a drunken father verbally abused and <gb> then <ge> hit a female tram driver <gb> on Friday evening <ge> in front of his four-year-old son .
the police announced <gb> in a statement on Saturday <ge> that the <gb> 49-year-old Berlin <ge> Transport Authority <gb> ( BVG ) <ge> worker had to stop on Seestrasse <gb> in Wedding <ge> when she was suddenly attacked <gb> by the 30-year-old man <ge> .

<gb> the fans of the vampire saga were not disappointed . vampire actor Robert <ge> Pattinson <gb> , his werewolf rival Taylor Lautner <ge> and <gb> &quot; Bella &quot; beauty Kristen <ge> Stewart signed autographs and posed with fans .
the <gb> DAX-listed <ge> company announced <gb> on Tuesday <ge> that around two billion dollars <gb> ( around 1.5 billion Euros ) <ge> is to be invested <gb> by 2015 <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we will create more research and development facilities and hire thousands of people <gb> , &quot; Bill McDermott , co-Chief executive of SAP , said in a statement at a consumer show in Peking <ge> .
the world market leader <gb> in enterprise software <ge> plans to double its number of offices <gb> from five to ten or eleven <ge> .
it contains few big names <gb> , major treaties or famous battles <ge> ; there are almost no ambassadors <gb> , dashing journalists or discussions of tactics and materiel <ge> .
it &apos;s not so much a book about what happened <gb> , he explains , <ge> as <gb> &quot; <ge> a book about what it was like . <gb> &quot; it &apos;s about &quot; feelings , impressions , experiences and moods . &quot; <ge>
their lives flicker here like votive candles lighted in a church <gb> ; new ones are added to the mix while some wink out <ge> .
it is a corrective <gb> too <ge> to the notion that World War I was only about the dire trench warfare <gb> on the Western Front <ge> .
soldiers in this book have beehives fall on them <gb> ; one has Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids ; tsetse flies are an intractable problem <ge> .
when cannon fire is heard <gb> in the distance <ge> , and you are a woman <gb> at home <ge> with <gb> your <ge> children , do you stay or flee ?
<gb> &quot; <ge> lack of facts <gb> , &quot; Mr. Englund observes , &quot; <ge> has been padded out with guesses <gb> , suppositions , hopes , fears , idées fixes , conspiracy theories , dreams , nightmares and rumors <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the accounts of their lives can be terrifying <gb> or stirring <ge> , but are most fully alive in Mr. Englund &apos;s accumulation of small moments <gb> , stray details <ge> .
there are <gb> , he notes , &quot; <ge> 837 registered meat substitutes permissible in the production of sausages , 511 registered coffee substitutes . <gb> &quot; <ge>
conversely a British soldier realizes that <gb> he will most likely die , and that <ge> no one will notice or care .
<gb> &quot; once one is resigned to the thought of sacrificing oneself , <ge> one would like to think that it might happen in front of an audience <gb> , &quot; he writes <ge> .
<gb> &quot; the <ge> conflict has increasingly become an economic competition , <gb> &quot; Mr. Englund writes , &quot; <ge> a war between factories . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> Mr. Englund discussed the <ge> soldiers <gb> who actively <ge> tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes as a way to evade service <gb> at the front <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonococcal pus <gb> , which soldiers buy and smear into their genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital , &quot; he writes <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> those who are really desperate rub it into their eyes <gb> , which often results in lifelong blindness <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> in dozens of small scenes <ge> he catches the way the war has <gb> &quot; <ge> unleashed uniquely uncontrollable forces <gb> : extreme nationalism , social revolution , religious hatred <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> but <ge> it &apos;s as if he has reached from his book , snatched that Dramatis personae page <gb> from your fingers , <ge> and lighted it with a match .
the operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers <gb> , with others initially being told that they were embarking on an exercise <ge> .
police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center <gb> , his presence underscoring how the operation was fraught with challenges for the Police Department <ge> .
there could be no repeat of episodes <gb> in recent weeks , like the pepper-spraying of protesters , <ge> that <gb> violated department rules and <ge> created <gb> a firestorm of <ge> public sympathy for the squatters .
<gb> and so <ge> the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters unfolded <gb> after two weeks of planning and training <ge> .
officials increased <gb> so-called <ge> disorder training <gb> - counterterrorism measures that involve moving large numbers of police officers quickly - <ge> to focus on Lower Manhattan .
the orders <gb> to move into the park <ge> came down at the <gb> &quot; <ge> last minute <gb> , &quot; said someone familiar with the orders , which referred to the assignment only as &quot; an exercise <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> the only people who were aware of them going into Zuccotti Park were at <gb> the very <ge> highest levels of the department . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> on Oct. 14 , <ge> officials wanted to clear the park <gb> , but then backed off as hundreds of protesters streamed in ahead of time after hearing of the plans <ge> .
Mr. Kelly said many people <gb> , almost like commuters , <ge> had been coming and going from the park <gb> during the day , making 1 a.m. a good time to move in <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> it was appropriate to do it when the smallest number of people were in the park <gb> , &quot; he said <ge> .
emergency Service Unit trucks <gb> with klieg lights and loudspeakers <ge> gathered <gb> at Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive , <ge> near the Manhattan Bridge <gb> , before moving out <ge> .
as the community affairs officers moved into the park <gb> in their light-blue windbreakers , many <ge> protesters <gb> simply <ge> gathered their belongings and left .
no tents were touched until 1 : 45 <gb> a.m. , the police said <ge> , giving the protesters time to gather their belongings .
other teams of officers were seen gathering on the perimeter <gb> to move in if arrests were needed in the park <ge> .
<gb> but many <ge> journalists said that they had been prevented from seeing the police take action in the park <gb> , and that they had been roughly handled by officers <ge> .
a core group of protesters took up positions close to the encampment &apos;s kitchen area <gb> , near the center of the park <ge> .
the highest-ranking officer on the scene was <gb> Joseph J. Esposito , the chief of department , <ge> the top uniformed officer in the department .
barricades were set up at Cortlandt Street <gb> , a block north of the park , and at Pine Street , a block south <ge> .
around 5 a.m. , <gb> south of Pine Street , <ge> one protester jumped on the hood of a police car <gb> , and others were seen releasing the air from the tires of a police van <ge> .
the lawsuit is <gb> possibly <ge> the last weapon available to the union <gb> , District Council 37 , <ge> in its effort to reverse the layoffs .
<gb> at a City Council hearing last month , Schools Chancellor Dennis M. <ge> Walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget they signed off on in June .
Elizabeth Thomas <gb> , a spokeswoman for the city &apos;s Law Department , <ge> said the city had not seen the lawsuit <gb> and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations <ge> .
<gb> P.S. 36 &quot; s budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year , and <ge> it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the extra financing <gb> for each poor student schools enroll <ge> .
the union <gb> also <ge> claims that high school principals may have been misled by the language <gb> in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> sixty-six parent coordinators were laid off <gb> , &quot; the draft complaint says , &quot; <ge> and not merely excessed . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> it finally looks like <ge> Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are ready to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya .
<gb> in June , <ge> Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya .
the bill was defeated in the House <gb> by a wide bipartisan margin , and it never came up for a vote in the Senate <ge> .
<gb> but on the same day that bill failed in the House , <ge> the chamber <gb> also <ge> voted down a measure that <gb> would have <ge> cut funding for American operations in Libya .
<gb> the resolution also &quot; affirms <ge> the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya . <gb> &quot; <ge>
will the new measure earn the full support <gb> of the Foreign Relations panel , <ge> or will it split lawmakers <gb> like the June bill did <ge> ?
across the Capitol , the House is to vote <gb> this week <ge> on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget <gb> , a top legislative priority of nearly every congressional Republican and some Democrats <ge> .
<gb> other <ge> lawmakers have been unsuccessful <gb> so far <ge> in bringing their amendments to the floor <gb> , but not for lack of trying <ge> .
<gb> some are duplicates - <ge> the same bill offered in both the House and Senate <gb> - and others are slight variations on each other <ge> .
there are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the House alone <gb> , and another handful that would &quot; control federal spending <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
some of those bills are identical <gb> too <ge> , but they give their sponsors <gb> - particularly freshmen Republicans looking to burnish their resumes - <ge> the chance to brag that they <gb> &quot; <ge> authored <gb> &quot; <ge> such a measure .
the Budget Control Act <gb> , which passed in August , <ge> required that both the House and Senate vote on a balanced budget amendment .
<gb> in March , <ge> 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution <gb> supporting the idea of such an amendment <ge> .
<gb> beyond the budget , <ge> several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve <gb> , while Rep. José E. Serrano ( D-N.Y. ) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents <ge> .
<gb> Rep. Jesse L. <ge> Jackson <gb> Jr . ( D-Ill . ) <ge> has offered a host of amendments <gb> guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care , among other subjects <ge> .
some lawmakers also want to allow for the nullification of federal laws <gb> if they are opposed by two-thirds of the states <ge> .
as eager as members have been to offer amendments <gb> , they &apos;re not moving at any faster pace than in past years <ge> .
<gb> in the 111th Congress , <ge> lawmakers offered 77 such amendments <gb> , and they introduced 66 in the 110th <ge> .
the pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s , <gb> when members regularly offered more than 150 amendments every two years , <ge> according to numbers provided by the Senate Library .
<gb> the last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 , but <ge> it was actually proposed by Congress in 1789 .
<gb> appearing <ge> on ABC News &apos;s &quot; 20 / 20 &quot; with Diane Sawyer , Giffords struggled to formed sentences and needed help walking .
three months ago , she made a surprise return to the House to <gb> triumphantly <ge> cast her vote <gb> on the debt-ceiling deal <ge> .
in her first television interview <gb> since the January shooting that killed six and wounded 13 <ge> , Giffords <gb> smiled , laughed and sang - and <ge> described her recovery as <gb> &quot; <ge> difficult . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> in videos shot by Kelly in the first few weeks , <ge> she is seen in her hospital bed <gb> , her head shaved and a long scar across her forehead <ge> .
<gb> months later , <ge> Giffords is seen sitting up in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple actions .
<gb> within days , <ge> Giffords uttered another word - &quot; toast <gb> , &quot; a request for a change in her breakfast menu <ge> .
in the interview <gb> with Sawyer <ge> , Giffords <gb> , who goes through two hours of therapy every day , <ge> said she has no memory of the day of the shooting .
suspected gunman Jared Lee Loughner is being <gb> held at a Missouri prison and is being <ge> forcibly medicated <gb> as he awaits trial <ge> .
at one point <gb> in his wife &apos;s recovery , Kelly told Sawyer , <ge> she said , &quot; I &apos;ve been beaten . &quot;
<gb> &quot; so , I would say , &quot; <ge> Gabby , you have not been beaten <gb> , &quot; &quot; Kelly said <ge> .
<gb> and <ge> you &apos;re going to get through this <gb> , and you &apos;re going to recover <ge> and you &apos;re going to come back stronger than ever .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the servicemen and women were regarded as heroes <gb> , &quot; said David Saltzman , who organized the spring fundraiser <ge> .
a senior military officer at the gala <gb> , also attended by the Joint Chiefs then-chairman , Adm. Mike Mullen , <ge> saw the troops &quot; role differently .
<gb> &quot; they were rolled out like some sort of orphan kid , &quot; <ge> the officer wrote in an e-mail .
the starkly conflicting impressions illustrate the uneasy relationship <gb> that has taken hold <ge> between the military and an often distant <gb> , sometimes adoring American <ge> public .
&quot; <gb> but it seems that <ge> the only way that some can be supportive is to cast us in the role of hapless souls . &quot;
the topic is a sensitive one for military leaders , who do not want to appear <gb> ungrateful or <ge> at odds with the public <gb> they serve <ge> .
they also realize that the anger <gb> that returning troops faced in the latter years of the Vietnam War <ge> was far worse .
<gb> after his two sons returned from combat tours with the Marines , retired Col. <ge> Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military would view their service from two perspectives .
some would look at them with <gb> a sense of <ge> awe because they faced down insurgents and traveled to exotic places .
others would wonder whether there was an <gb> &quot; <ge> angry <gb> , violent <ge> veteran beneath the surface <gb> , &quot; said Cancian , who fought in Iraq and returned to a senior government job in Washington <ge> .
<gb> during his job search , <ge> he said <gb> , he sensed <ge> that some interviewers had <gb> subtly <ge> inquired whether he would be able to hold up under the strain <gb> of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> when you talk about your service , you need to counter the negative impressions <gb> , &quot; Cancian recalled telling his sons <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we <gb> , as a nation , <ge> no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II <gb> , &quot; said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno , who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan <ge> .
instead , praise from politicians <gb> and the public <ge> focuses largely on the depth of <gb> a service member &apos;s <ge> suffering .
troops are recognized for the number of tours they have endured <gb> , the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries <ge> .
Pfc. Elizabeth Lyman was <gb> 25 years old and 11 weeks <ge> pregnant the night she <gb> says she <ge> was raped <gb> by a fellow soldier <ge> .
<gb> within minutes of entering Lyman &apos;s room , <ge> the man came up from behind her , throwing her down and raping her <gb> , she alleges <ge> .
the suit alleges that Gates <gb> and Rumsfeld <ge> failed to curtail widespread rape within the military <gb> , in violation of soldiers &quot; constitutional rights <ge> .
<gb> Burke also says that since February , <ge> she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors <gb> , many of whom could be part of future suits <ge> .
the defense team for the Department of Defense <gb> , led by United States Attorney Neil MacBride , <ge> has filed a motion to dismiss the case .
per a 1950 Supreme Court ruling <gb> called the Feres Doctrine <ge> , the federal government is not liable for injury <gb> sustained by active-duty personnel <ge> .
<gb> in both Iraq and Afghanistan , <ge> teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles <gb> , especially in reaching out to local women in war zones <ge> .
<gb> the result : <ge> between <gb> those <ge> two wars , 150 female soldiers have died <gb> - two thirds of them during combat situations <ge> .
at Yale <gb> Law School <ge> , the Veterans &quot; Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies <gb> for allegedly fostering a misogynistic atmosphere <ge> .
her group filed a suit <gb> in December <ge> against the Veterans Administration , charging it with discriminatory practices <gb> in the way it handles benefit claims for people who say they were sexually assaulted in the service <ge> .
nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress <gb> by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives , proposing a range of fixes <ge> .
in 2010 there were 3,158 sexual assaults reported , according to the <gb> Department of Defense &apos;s Sexual Assault <ge> Prevention and Response Office .
<gb> but assaults are notoriously underreported , and <ge> by the Pentagon &apos;s own estimate , that figure accounts for <gb> approximately <ge> 13.5 percent of the <gb> estimated 19,000 <ge> incidents <gb> that occurred that year <ge> .
the report <gb> , released in March , <ge> also examines prosecution rates <gb> : in 2010 , 20 percent of reported cases in the military went to trial - half the rate of the civilian justice system <ge> .
<gb> in Lyman &apos;s case , <ge> she reported the alleged rape to military police <gb> less than an hour after it occurred <ge> .
that night , she <gb> says , she <ge> was asked to recount the details of her rape 11 separate times <gb> to a stream of police , doctors , and commanders <ge> .
<gb> she did a rape kit , and <ge> her assailant &apos;s blood <gb> - from a cut on his arm - <ge> was found in her bed .
six months later , <gb> in April 2009 , <ge> Lyman sat through a hearing before a judge <gb> , during which she was questioned about having had sex with her boyfriend earlier on the day of the attack <ge> .
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist , who <gb> eventually <ge> diagnosed her <gb> with <ge> a personality disorder , rendering her unfit for service .
as for whether the case <gb> filed by Lyman and her fellow plaintiffs <ge> moves forward , it &apos;s a long shot <gb> , says John Turley , professor of law at George Washington University Law School <ge> .
what stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine <gb> that has been criticized since it was first issued <ge> .
<gb> he adds , &quot; <ge> The odds are heavily against them <gb> ... but it &apos;s important for them to try <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
if the hearing doesn &apos;t go their way , Burke <gb> , the plaintiffs &quot; lawyer , <ge> will cue up her <gb> hundreds of <ge> other plaintiffs <gb> for future cases <ge> .
<gb> before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe , <ge> Anders Behring Breivik was <gb> just another guy <ge> airing his anti-immigration views online .
on Monday <gb> , <ge> Breivik <gb> , who admitted to a killing spree in Norway in July which left 77 people dead , <ge> faced his first public court hearing .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we realized that it wasn &apos;t that difficult to get to them at all <gb> , &quot; says Jamie Bartlett , the lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by British think tank DEMOS <ge> .
by reaching out through Facebook , <gb> Bartlett and <ge> his colleagues were able to survey over 10,000 followers <gb> of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without ever leaving the office <ge> .
<gb> some of the results aren &apos;t all that surprising : <ge> online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be <gb> young , male , and <ge> vexed by immigration .
<gb> but in something of a twist , &quot; <ge> those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable <gb> , more democratic and less violent than those who just remain behind the computer screen <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> demos &apos;s work is just one example of how <ge> Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists .
think tanks <gb> , medical researchers and political scientists <ge> are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends <gb> as expressed in &apos; Likes &apos; , wall posts and status updates <ge> .
<gb> &quot; you &apos;d have to go through the party and <ge> they would never allow you access <gb> , &quot; says Bartlett <ge> .
<gb> on Facebook , <ge> it &apos;s impossible to know how much of a user &apos;s profile information and wall posts are true .
<gb> which is why , despite his years as a technology researcher , <ge> Selwyn thinks a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use .
<gb> &quot; <ge> there &apos;s no substitute for going into the real world <gb> and speaking to real people , &quot; he says <ge> .
Anders Behring Breivik <gb> , the man who confessed to masterminding twin attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer , <ge> has described himself as a <gb> &quot; <ge> resistance <gb> &quot; <ge> fighter <gb> during his first public court appearance in Oslo <ge> .
&quot; I object <gb> to the court <ge> because you received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and <gb> because it <ge> supports multiculturalism . &quot;
<gb> judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue <ge> because he <gb> &quot; <ge> did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing <gb> as a platform for him <ge> to express his views . <gb> &quot; <ge>
Nesheim also ordered police to hold Breivik in custody <gb> for 12 more weeks , banned him from accessing media for four weeks , and said that authorities will have tight control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks <ge> .
some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye <gb> , others to confirm that he is being held under lock and key <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> it was uncomfortable , but for me I moved on a little bit after seeing <gb> and hearing <ge> the suspect . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> dressed in a dark suit and blue tie , <ge> Breivik remained calm and <gb> professional throughout the hearing and <ge> looked <gb> journalists and <ge> survivors in the eye <gb> as he entered and exited the building <ge> .
it may comfort some that the <gb> July 22 <ge> attacks seem to be the work of one extremist <gb> rather than a group of radicals <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I wish he looked like a monster , but he doesn &apos;t <gb> , &quot; a relative of one victim said <ge> .
following the death of Steve Jobs <gb> on Oct. 5 <ge> , there were some who compared him to Henry Ford <gb> - singling out the tech genius as the Great Modern Inventor <ge> .
it was only following Jobs &quot; death that a <gb> complete <ge> VHS copy was discovered <gb> in the director &apos;s garage <ge> .
this footage <gb> , slightly re-edited , <ge> is the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs : the Lost Interview , coming to Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday .
for someone known to loathe in-depth interviews , Jobs seems <gb> surprisingly <ge> eager here to expound on his <gb> technological philosophies and <ge> business strategies .
<gb> it &apos;s one thing to read posthumous appraisals of Jobs &quot; career , <ge> but there &apos;s something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here <gb> , the anxious dreamer on the brink of greatness <ge> .
the device has been <gb> widely <ge> written about before , but Jobs &quot; euphoria <gb> here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment <ge> is infectious .
he describes how <gb> he and <ge> Wozniak would test the box by using a pay phone <gb> , placing a call , and then connecting from one AT &amp; T network to another while looping in as many satellites as possible <ge> .
<gb> &quot; we were young and what we learned was that <ge> we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world . <gb> &quot; <ge>
at the age of 12 , <gb> on the hunt for spare parts to build a frequency counter , <ge> he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book <gb> and gave him a call <ge> .
<gb> &quot; that made a remarkable influence on me , <ge> it was the only company I had seen <gb> at that age <ge> and it formed my view of what a company was <gb> and how well they treated their employees <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company &apos;s <gb> Palo Alto <ge> research labs <gb> , where he saw &quot; the first desktop computer ever made <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
it was as big as a suitcase <gb> , had a small cathode ray tube display , <ge> and I fell in love with it .
I would <gb> get a <ge> ride up to HP <gb> as a teenager <ge> and hang around that machine and write programs for it .
early in his career , <gb> as he set out to sell a handful of circuit boards , <ge> he was asked by a customer to assemble the full computer .
<gb> working on only 30 days of credit , <ge> he had to figure out both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices .
<gb> &quot; say you work at IBM or Xerox , so <ge> you make a better copier or printer , so what ? <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> sales and marketing makes it more successful , so &#91; it &apos;s those kinds of people &#93; who end up running companies and <ge> the product people get driven out of the decision-making forum .
the product genius <gb> that led to that monopolistic position <ge> is rotted out by people who have no conception of good products <gb> vs. bad products - the craftsmanship required <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> there &apos;s a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product <gb> ... as you evolve that great idea , it changes and grows <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
there are tradeoffs you have to make - <gb> certain <ge> things you can &apos;t make electrons do , glass do , robots do , factories do .
one of the cases at issue was a suit <gb> brought by 26 states <ge> challenging the <gb> sweeping <ge> healthcare overhaul passed by Congress <gb> last year , a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists nationwide <ge> .
the lawyer <gb> who will stand before the court and argue that the law should be thrown out <ge> is likely to be Paul Clement , who served as U.S. solicitor general <gb> during the George W. Bush administration <ge> .
Clement &apos;s law firm <gb> , Bancroft PLLC , <ge> was one of <gb> almost <ge> two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner <gb> of the Federalist Society , a longstanding group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles <ge> .
another firm <gb> that sponsored the dinner , Jones Day , <ge> represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law <gb> , the National Federation of Independent Business <ge> .
<gb> another sponsor was <ge> pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc <gb> , which <ge> has an enormous financial stake in the outcome of the litigation .
in attendance was <gb> , among others , <ge> Mitch McConnell <gb> , the <ge> Senate &apos;s top Republican and an avowed opponent of the healthcare law .
<gb> in fact , <ge> justices are exempt from the Code of Conduct <gb> that governs the actions of lower federal justices <ge> .
nevertheless , the sheer proximity <gb> of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest , <ge> was enough to alarm <gb> ethics-in-government <ge> activists .
<gb> &quot; the <ge> justices were wining and dining at a black-tie fundraiser <gb> with attorneys who have pending cases before the court <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics <gb> who say they too readily mix the business of the court with agenda-driven groups such as the Federalist Society <ge> .
<gb> moreover , <ge> conservatives argue that it &apos;s Justice Elena Kagan who has an ethical issue <gb> , not Scalia and Thomas <ge> .
Kagan served as solicitor general in the Obama administration <gb> when the first legal challenges to the law were brought at the trial court level <ge> .
<gb> her critics have pushed for Kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case , saying that <ge> she was too invested in defending the law then to be impartial now .
<gb> but it &apos;s a big deal when the company is airplane-maker Boeing Co. and <ge> the list price for those 50 airplanes totals a record $ 18 billion .
in a forecast <gb> released Monday <ge> , the <gb> Chicago <ge> company estimates that airlines <gb> in the Middle East over the next 20 years <ge> will need 2,520 airplanes <gb> worth $ 450 billion <ge> .
Boeing <gb> over the weekend <ge> announced its biggest-ever order <gb> by dollar value <ge> for commercial airplanes <gb> - 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 jets <ge> .
the airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes , <gb> which would push the total list price to $ 26 billion , <ge> Boeing announced <gb> at the 2011 Dubai Air Show <ge> .
<gb> then on Monday , <ge> Boeing said Oman Air ordered six Boeing <gb> 787-8s , the so-called Dreamliner , which boasts dramatically better fuel economy and passenger amenities . <ge>
<gb> that &apos;s important because <ge> they will be less likely <gb> than other airlines <ge> to cancel or delay airplane orders when fuel prices rise <gb> , Dihora said <ge> .
the <gb> Emirates <ge> order solidifies Boeing &apos;s lead in the market for wide-body planes <gb> and helps hold at bay competitor Airbus SAS &apos; attempt to encroach on its dominance with the A350 airliner <ge> .
Boeing &apos;s win <gb> at the air show <ge> comes four months after Airbus said it would push back the debut of the <gb> largest <ge> A350 <gb> , which competes directly with the 777-300ER <ge> .
<gb> Luisa Maria Calderon alleges that <ge> drug traffickers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo <gb> of the PRI <ge> in the governor &apos;s race .
<gb> President Felipe <ge> Calderon &apos;s sister appears to have lost her bid <gb> for governor of Michoacan <ge> during violent state elections <gb> , and she alleged Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents <ge> .
preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state <gb> to Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI <ge> .
Vallejo <gb> , former mayor of the state capital of Morelia , <ge> denied ties to drug traffickers <gb> and urged the other candidates to accept the results <ge> .
a PAN mayor was assassinated a week before the election <gb> as he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon , and numerous candidates quit local races out of fear <ge> .
for the PRI , <gb> though , however nasty the Michoacan election looks , <ge> a win will help the party &apos;s momentum .
<gb> &quot; so <ge> anybody who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful <gb> , &quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai <ge> .
in recent days , <gb> Italy &apos;s <ge> borrowing costs have soared <gb> dangerously <ge> and the prime ministers <gb> of both Italy and Greece <ge> have resigned .
the <gb> unfolding <ge> sovereign debt crisis <gb> in Europe <ge> has raised fears that it could push the global economy back into recession <gb> and prompted calls for leading emerging economies to band together to help the eurozone find a solution <ge> .
<gb> &quot; it is not an option , it is an imperative , because <ge> where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women . <gb> &quot; <ge>
others argue that developing economies <gb> like India <ge> have no business helping wealthy Europeans <gb> when they face their own profound economic challenges <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> sometime they will find out that Greeks retire at the age of 50 and <gb> go on holiday to beaches and <ge> it won &apos;t go down well <gb> , &quot; he said <ge> .
the ADB &apos;s forecast of <gb> 7.5 per cent <ge> economic growth <gb> in Asia for 2011 / 12 <ge> now faced <gb> &quot; <ge> risks on the downside <gb> &quot; because of the threat from Europe <ge> .
he said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make &quot; contingency plans &quot; to protect themselves from a downturn <gb> and significant capital outflows from their economies <ge> .
the Pentagon <gb> already <ge> is digesting $ 450 billion <gb> of reductions over the next decade <ge> but <gb> now <ge> fears an additional $ 600 billion <gb> or more in cuts <ge> may be imminent <gb> if Congress cannot reach a deal on spending <ge> .
he said <gb> that <ge> congressional failure to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestration would trigger 23 % across-the-board reductions and a halt <gb> to many <ge> new projects .
<gb> &quot; <ge> while wartime funding <gb> in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts <ge> is not <gb> directly <ge> affected by the sequester , war efforts would be <gb> adversely <ge> affected by the <gb> severe <ge> disruption in the base budgets <gb> , &quot; Panetta warned <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> contracting personnel would be cut <gb> , resulting in delays in the contracts and the contract oversight that support the war <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> payroll personnel would be cut <gb> , resulting in late payments to wartime vendors , <ge> and legal and policy support would be disrupted . &quot;
<gb> &quot; <ge> the consequence of a sequester on the Defense Department would set off a swift decline of the United States <gb> as the world &apos;s leading military power <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
&quot; we are staunchly opposed to this draconian action , &quot; the senators said <gb> in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta &apos;s letter <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the sequester is a threat <gb> to the national security interests of the United States , <ge> and it should not be allowed to occur . <gb> &quot; <ge>
whether the Panetta letter <gb> and the fresh warnings from Senators <ge> will increase pressure for a budget compromise <gb> or step up calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts <ge> remains to be seen .
Panetta has been <gb> increasingly <ge> outspoken about the possible cuts , although he came to the <gb> top Pentagon <ge> job with years of <gb> budget <ge> expertise <gb> himself in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing tough choices <ge> .
<gb> at a news conference last week , <ge> the secretary of defense painted a bleak picture of what could lie ahead <gb> -- a military with a shell but no core <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> it &apos;s a force that <gb> suffers low morale , poor readiness and <ge> is unable to keep up with potential adversaries . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> and <ge> Panetta said that some of the <gb> biggest <ge> defense projects could face the ax <gb> , including those already being tested and some just in early stages of planning <ge> .
administrators at Penn State have been charged with perjury <gb> for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting boys <ge> .
<gb> last week French president <ge> Nicolas Sarkozy was caught <gb> on an open microphone <ge> asserting <gb> to U.S. President Barack Obama <ge> that <gb> Israeli Prime Minister <ge> Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar .
<gb> new York congressman and Internet flasher <ge> Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself issuing denials quickly contradicted by incontrovertible evidence .
<gb> former presidential candidate <ge> John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations <gb> connected to the cover-up of an extramarital affair <ge> .
<gb> and then again , <ge> no one <gb> who lived through it <ge> will ever forget the media circus <gb> President Bill <ge> Clinton unleashed by lying <gb> during his second term in office <ge> about his sexual involvement <gb> with Monica Lewinsky <ge> .
there have been instances where teachers have given students test answers <gb> in order <ge> to make themselves look good on their performance reviews .
<gb> on a given day , studies show , <ge> you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times .
detecting lies <gb> , or &quot; lie spotting , &quot; <ge> is an essential skill for everyone to acquire <gb> , for both personal and professional reasons <ge> .
a trained lie spotter can get to the truth by learning about statement structure <gb> , facial micro-expressions , question formation and timing <ge> .
good liars are skilled at reading others well <gb> , putting them at ease , managing their own emotions and intuitively sensing how others perceive them <ge> .
<gb> we also know that <ge> if you are perceived as a wrongdoer , others will feel less guilt in lying to you .
someone might use lots of <gb> &quot; <ge> qualifying language <gb> &quot; <ge> when answering a hard question <gb> : &quot; well ... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
these skills will enhance anyone &apos;s chances of avoiding victimization <gb> by scam artists in their professional and personal lives <ge> .
TransCanada said <gb> Monday evening <ge> it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive <gb> Sandhills <ge> area of Nebraska <gb> , and is confident the project will still win approval <ge> .
<gb> TransCanada official <ge> Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident <gb> it will eventually get a pipeline approved , albeit with a different route <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> this is a real path forward <gb> , &quot; Rep. Lee Terry , a Republican from Nebraska , told Fox News <ge> .
the new environmental review <gb> ordered by the State Department likely <ge> would push off any decision until 2013 <gb> , after next year &apos;s elections , though officials denied that politics was involved in the decision <ge> .
Obama <gb> , in a written statement last week , <ge> described the decision as the State Department &apos;s call <gb> , and expressed support for it <ge> .
but <gb> Nebraska <ge> lawmakers <gb> opposed to the plan <ge> are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sand Hills region <gb> and Ogallala aquifer , a major source of drinking water and irrigation <ge> .
one is whether a lobbyist <gb> hired by TransCanada , Paul Elliott , who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008 , <ge> represents a conflict of interest for the program .
<gb> the other is whether <ge> a firm that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice <gb> because it was tied to TransCanada <ge> .
a <gb> New York <ge> family claims that <gb> disco diva <ge> Patti LaBelle launched into a rampage <gb> in the lobby of their Manhattan building <ge> , terrifying their toddler daughter <gb> to the point where she threw up in fear <ge> .
it was Nov. 10 <gb> of last year <ge> when stagehand Kevin Monk <gb> , his kindergarten-teacher wife , Roseanna , <ge> and Genevieve were getting ready to go on a family trip .
<gb> while <ge> Kevin Monk got the car , Roseanna Monk came down <gb> to the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard building <ge> with their luggage <gb> , <ge> carrying Genevieve .
<gb> &quot; someone came up behind me and said , &quot; <ge> Do you know what your daughter is doing ? <gb> &quot; I said &quot; yes &quot; and went to pick her up , &quot; she said . <ge>
<gb> &quot; she said in an aggressive tone , &quot; <ge> You shouldn &apos;t have left your daughter <gb> by the door , &quot; &quot; Roseanna Monk said <ge> .
<gb> &quot; I said to this woman , &quot; <ge> Look what you &apos;ve done to my daughter <gb> , &quot; &quot; the child &apos;s mother said <ge> .
the suit seeks unspecified damages , but the family &apos;s lawyer <gb> , Sam Davis , <ge> said he took the case for free <gb> and that the family plans to donate any money it gets to a children &apos;s cancer charity <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> that kind of behavior is completely unacceptable <gb> , especially when aimed at a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
during the first year of <gb> Mario Lopez Valdez <ge> management , <gb> in Sinaloa increased the unemployment and the informality , <ge> foreign investment declined <gb> and the economy was reduced <ge> .
the monthly average income of Sinaloa workers was , until September , 5.352 pesos <gb> , well below the national average , that is of 7.375 pesos <ge> .
<gb> for business representatives , <ge> the first year of Mario Lopez Valdes government demonstrates a lack of capacity of the government .
Lopez Loredo said that <gb> the events such as <ge> early frost this year stopped the <gb> state <ge> economy and its performance and growth were restricted .
the General Attorney Office reported that the sentenced drug dealer is <gb> Omar Alexis Valenzuela <ge> Sandoval <gb> , for the crime against health , in its variant of possession of marijuana for purposes of trade <ge> .
for these reasons , the insured was put at the disposal of the Second District Court <gb> and the sentenced person continues to be a prisoner at the Center for Supporting the Legal Consequences of the Crime <ge> .
&quot; they have to contribute with almost 12 million <gb> and even though the year is ending they have not given us a dime <ge> . &quot;
the replacement of analog with digital is one of the most important changes <gb> that has hit the world in recent years <ge>
in his speech , the minister said <gb> he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that <ge> the federal executive cannot structure <gb> through general rules <ge> the measures for the public administration to get prepared .
the replacement of analog to digital <gb> is one of the most important changes that have hit the world in recent years , and <ge> results in a better utilization of the radio-electric spectrum <gb> , better signal quality and more channels <ge> .
he recalled that a large number of countries <gb> around the world <ge> has now completed the digital transition <gb> , and has done it through the executive , despite of having highly specialized technical bodies <ge> .
the remains of the pilot <gb> Felipe Bacio Cortes <ge> arrived in <gb> Saltillo , <ge> his hometown <gb> , this Sunday night ; on Monday there were carried out the reconnaissance and a requiem mass <ge> .
<gb> at noon <ge> the ashes of the Lieutenant Colonel arrived at the chapel <gb> located on the boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza <ge> , where family and friends were coming .
Felipe Cortes Bacio left <gb> very young the city of <ge> Saltillo <gb> in order <ge> to enter the College of the Air in Zapopan , Jalisco .
his nephew <gb> Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio <ge> remembers him as a very good person <gb> , &quot; just arrived in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him , as when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
Bacio Cortés died the past days <gb> when the helicopter he piloted collapsed <ge> , along with Secretary of the Provincial Government <gb> , José Francisco Blake Mora , <ge> and six others <gb> , all officials of this department <ge> .
<gb> hours before the discovery , <ge> the military authority presented in media eleven persons who were detained <gb> in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime <ge> .
three men were found shot dead in <gb> different parts of the body and with the shot of grace , in <ge> an abandoned farm <gb> of the municipality of Cadereyta Jimenez , Nuevo Leon <ge> .
the discovery occurred at kilometer 1.5 of the Cadereyta road to Santiago <gb> , at the height of the community known as El Castillo <ge> .
<gb> looking inward , at about three meters , <ge> they located the bodies of three people <gb> , so they immediately gave notice to the corresponding authorities <ge> .
<gb> according to the data obtained there , <ge> the three persons were killed in another place <gb> , since there were no cases on the site <ge> .
<gb> according to the released information , initially ​ ​ on November 11th in the colony of Los Alvero <ge> there were arrested eight people and one person <gb> who remained deprived of his / her liberty <ge> was rescued .
they were given three houses and a cell phone , claiming to be members of <gb> the criminal group called &quot; <ge> Los Zetas . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> by stopping them and making the inspection , <ge> the militaries found a rifle <gb> , a chamber and 18 cartridges <ge> .
subsequently , <gb> after these statements , on November 13th at 14 : 00 <ge> one of his accomplices was stopped in the common land of La Pravda <gb> , who seeing the military tried to escape <ge> .
the <gb> appointed <ge> prime minister <gb> , Mario Monti , <ge> will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy <gb> in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put the country on the edge of an economic disaster <ge>
a statement <gb> from the presidential palace <ge> announced that Monti <gb> , named on Sunday , <ge> will meet <gb> on Wednesday <ge> with the president <gb> , Giorgio Napolitano , to confirm that he can form a government <ge> .
he is expected to present a cabinet composed largely of technocrats <gb> , although it is unclear when the new executive will undertake the position <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> I want to confirm my <gb> complete <ge> confidence in the ability of <gb> our country of <ge> getting out of this difficult phase <gb> , &quot; said the former European commissioner to the reporters <ge> .
<gb> Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government but <ge> the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome .
<gb> the <ge> new administration <gb> led by the former European Commissioner Monti <ge> must approve a tough austerity package <gb> demanded by the European leaders <ge> in order to regain the confidence in Italy .
<gb> underlying the pressure on Monti to hurry , <ge> the instable markets put the yield of the Italian BTP bonds to <gb> 10-year above 7 percent , the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued . <ge>
<gb> Emma Marcegaglia , leader of the Italian employers &apos; Federation told the reporters after meeting with Monti : &quot; <ge> we said we would support <gb> very much <ge> this government . <gb> &quot; <ge>
Monti &apos;s chances of success were <gb> considerably <ge> boosted by the support of the LDP party <gb> of Silvio Berlusconi , who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to have a good outcome <gb> , &quot; said to the reporters Angelino Alfano , secretary of the center-right party <ge> .
<gb> any <ge> blockage or delay <gb> in their efforts could <ge> lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets .
the <gb> Italian <ge> association of foreign banks added to the pressure <gb> by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster <ge> .
Monti began on Monday his consultations with the political parties <gb> , unions and business groups , as well as with youth and women organizations <ge> .
Monti was appointed <gb> on Sunday <ge> by Napolitano , who has enabled an extremely rapid transition <gb> in response to the crisis <ge> .
after a brief rest at the end of last week , <gb> when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign , <ge> the Italian debt costs have now reached critical levels <gb> between uncertainties about whether the new prime minister will succeed <ge> .
rescuing Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion Euros would be too much <gb> for the current financial defenses of the euro zone <ge> .
Monti has said that his government would last until the next elections <gb> scheduled for 2013 , <ge> despite the widespread predictions <gb> that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms before moving forward with the elections <ge> .
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet , <gb> but the major parties insist that it must be made only of technicians , <ge> an indication of his objections to a process <gb> forced by the financial pressure <ge> .
political sources said that the mutual mistrust and disagreement <gb> between the parties <ge> are complicating the attempt <gb> to include political figures <ge> .
a minor contrast to Costa Rica , comparing the 22 players called <gb> by both countries <ge> for the friendly game <gb> today , at 3 : 05 pm at the National Stadium in San Jose <ge> .
Casillas will <gb> play today against the Tricolor and <ge> will impose a new record of 127 international matches <gb> for Spain <ge> .
after this , only five exceeded the 30 games <gb> : Keilor Navas with 31 , Randall Azofeifa with 32 , Michael Barrantes with 31 , Carlos Hernandez with 36 and Jose Luis Lopez with 35 <ge> .
on the national side , <gb> with less than 30 presences , <ge> there are Roy Miller <gb> with 26 , Winston Parks with 26 , Gabriel Badilla with 25 <ge> and Roy Myrie <gb> with 23 <ge> .
while Nacho Moreal has only four games <gb> and Jordi Alba two <ge> , <gb> in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one Olman Vargas and <ge> Nelson Edder did not debut yet .
the leading scorer of Spain is <gb> David Villa is , with 50 goals , <ge> followed by Fernando Torres <gb> with 27 <ge> .
<gb> for Costa Rica , <ge> Bryan Ruiz is the one that registers more points <gb> , two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks <ge> .
<gb> in an exclusive interview with Viva , the bassist <ge> Jeff Ament <gb> , of Pearl Jam , <ge> said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts <gb> next Sunday at the National Stadium <ge> .
this was stated by the bassist and founding member <gb> , Jeff Ament , who spoke exclusively with Viva , from Brazil , last week <ge> .
the group is on the South American zone within the tour <gb> celebrating two decades of work <ge> and Sunday 20th will make its only stop in Central America .
<gb> that day <ge> they will be present at the National Stadium , <gb> starting at 7 : 30 pm , <ge> together with the band of Los Angeles <gb> The X and the band of the nationals Las Robertas <ge> .
<gb> I &apos;ve been to Costa Rica only once , on vacation , <ge> it is a beautiful country and I think we &apos;ll be able to stay a few days there .
<gb> I ask this because there is a kind of devotion to the band ; <ge> the fans live with intensity the days before the concert .
it took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica <gb> , thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get here <ge> .
<gb> some of <ge> the biggest shows we &apos;ve played <gb> over the past 21 years <ge> occurred <gb> during <ge> the last couple of weeks .
we had a few wonderful shows <gb> in Sao Paulo <ge> and we hope that this has put us in shape <gb> for this concert in Costa Rica <ge> .
<gb> we love this country , we love to surf and the jungle , <ge> for both things , Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world .
my friends are always going to surf in Costa Rica and <gb> Nicaragua , along with Mexico , these are great places to surf , and <ge> that &apos;s how we learned about <gb> , through people who love surfing <ge> .
<gb> that makes the show more interesting for us and therefore <ge> I think it <gb> also <ge> makes it more interesting for the people .
<gb> from time to time , arises a band of a city , <ge> but it is much more strange when <gb> five or <ge> ten bands come out at the same time <gb> from the same city <ge> .
<gb> yes , <ge> four of us were together for 21 years <gb> and Matt ( Cameron ) joined us 13 years ago <ge> , which <gb> , by itself , <ge> is <gb> much <ge> longer than many bands lasted .
we are all very close friends and <gb> , thanks to this , <ge> there have also been opened musical avenues <gb> that give each the freedom to experiment <ge> .
we take care of not being too much on tour <gb> because it is easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who love your music <ge> .
we were a band for almost three years <gb> and never released an album until after the death of Andy ( Andrew Woods ) <ge> .
is it true that you know its work <gb> , especially Eddie Vedder , <ge> and that &apos;s why you chose it for the opening ?
<gb> yes , <ge> the production sent us several videos <gb> proposals <ge> and that was the band that we liked most <gb> , so we &apos;re anxious to see what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining <ge> .
<gb> also , <ge> I think you can <gb> be a happy person and <ge> still be able to make music that is dark .
the ex President <gb> Alberto Fujimori <ge> was hospitalized <gb> Tuesday in a public hospital <ge> in order to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength <gb> that occurs in the legs , informed his family doctor <ge> .
<gb> Aguinaga said that <ge> in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for getting the benefit of pardon on humanitarian grounds <gb> ; however , he said he did not want this because he knows he is innocent <ge> .
in his speech , Sarkozy threatened to exclude <gb> from the international community <ge> those countries that remain tax havens <gb> , a statement that caused the refusal of Uruguay and the call to consultation of its ambassador in the European country <ge> .
on the trade plan , Mexico and Uruguay have in force <gb> since 2004 <ge> a Free Trade Agreement <gb> ( FTA ) that has increased the exchange of goods between both countries <ge> .
Nintendo spokesman has claimed that <gb> , despite being in 3D , &quot; <ge> Super Mario <gb> 3D Land &quot; <ge> is an <gb> &quot; <ge> accessible <gb> &quot; <ge> video game <gb> which allows enjoying a quick and fluid game <ge> .
<gb> Alvarez said that <ge> &quot; Super Mario <gb> 3D Land &quot; contains two games in one : the first part is &quot; simple &quot; to engage less skilled users . <ge>
<gb> once pasted , <ge> most experts will give a &quot; second round &quot; to the levels of the play <gb> , which this time , are more difficult <ge> .
<gb> in this game Nintendo winks to the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula of the previous games , <ge> the plumber <gb> with mustache <ge> will have to go through <gb> dangerous <ge> mined platforms in order to free princess Peach .
at a press conference , Colom said that his decision is according to the independence of judiciary <gb> and executive <ge> powers <gb> , taking into account that a trial court had already ordered the extradition <ge> .
he stated that during his mandate he <gb> did not &quot; put his hands &quot; in judicial decisions and <ge> accepted all extradition proceedings <gb> he has ever known <ge> .
what &apos;s done by Colom represents an executive process <gb> after getting exhausted all legal and constitutional courts <ge> to prosecute the ex head of state <gb> between 2000 and 2004 <ge> .
in accordance with the resolutions of the <gb> Fifth Criminal Court and the <ge> Constitutional Court <gb> ( CC ) <ge> , Portillo will be extradited <gb> once resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and guaranteed his human rights <ge> .
the balance of the first 25 years of life <gb> of the social support entity Trinijove <ge> is important <gb> : 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this century quarter <ge> .
the <gb> yesterday <ge> celebration <gb> at Sant Andreu <ge> gathered a large number of responsible entities <gb> and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association <ge> .
the diverse political representation <gb> , <ge> in the election time <gb> , <ge> showed the unitary character of the work done <gb> by Trinijove <ge> .
he said Trinijove was born in a <gb> very <ge> difficult time <gb> and that the current period is also difficult <ge> , but added that the work <gb> done so far &quot; <ge> is a good base . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the president gave Trinijove as an example <gb> for fighting against the bad circumstances and giving hope to people with difficulties <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the crisis is not new to the <gb> entity and the <ge> work done by it <gb> , &quot; he said <ge> .
twelve people left <gb> voluntarily yesterday at noon <ge> the property they were illegally occupying <gb> , and where they organized macro parties that exasperated the neighborhood , by court order without police intervention <ge> .
the first three floors were the scene of mass parties <gb> , which lasted up to two days and exasperated the tenants <ge> .
the owner <gb> , Maria Pantinat <ge> told to Europa Press that <gb> since the building was occupied <ge> her business went down 80 % .
the owner of the club says that the invaders <gb> of the farm <ge> made her an unfair competition <gb> , since they were selling drinks for three Euros , while in the club worth 10 <ge> .
<gb> in this sense , he added that &quot; <ge> it is necessary to <gb> put an end to impunity and to <ge> be strongly against the incivility that has been generated on the farm . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> at 15 : 30 <ge> the police went to 35 Montral Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had noticed that four people had entered the building .
<gb> in mid 80 &apos;s at the height of the now extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona ( MCB ) , <ge> this Administration printed promotional leaflets of Collserola .
the reference was not Central Park <gb> , but Yellowstone , with the wild boar on the role of Yogi Bear <ge> .
this was all about until <gb> , in September , <ge> the council called for a mega competition <gb> composed of 16 contests for as many other doors to Collserola <ge> .
the competition , <gb> both as for its merely organizational side as for its reflection on the city <ge> is a topic of conversation among <gb> all <ge> architects of Barcelona .
it &apos;s <gb> almost <ge> a recurrent theme to make use of when two members of this <gb> ancient <ge> lineage of elected persons recognize themselves in an elevator .
and this fact gives rise <gb> precisely <ge> to one of the few similarities <gb> between what three architects of Barcelona are saying and the academics , which have been presented <ge> .
Modolo <gb> , as Roland and Bayona with experience in the urban world , <ge> called the proposal <gb> &quot; <ge> intellectual challenge <gb> &quot; <ge> with <gb> &quot; <ge> some dangers . <gb> &quot; <ge>
hazards arising from the <gb> &quot; <ge> uncertainty of projecting the public space <gb> &quot; after the experience of the 80 &quot; s which had in the Forum area &quot; his swan song <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> we must think of new urban planning tools , because the current <gb> &#91; in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan ( GMP ) &#93; <ge> can lead to a real disaster . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> tighter to the question , <ge> Modolo believes that simplifying the <gb> Collserola <ge> valley side <gb> &quot; <ge> can be understood as a park <gb> , Barcelona , ​ ​ not &quot; by a purely topographical issue <ge> .
otherwise , a project <gb> for one of the gates <ge> can crash into the <gb> program and <ge> definition with the project of the architect of the next gate .
<gb> in your opinion , <ge> the council should ensure <gb> that the band immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide in its entirety , <ge> an area of equipment to conduct a smooth transition between the city and the green .
after 72 days <gb> of arrangements <ge> , the legal representative <gb> of the Red Casino <ge> forgave the brother of the <gb> mayor of Monterrey of the <ge> process against him <gb> for alleged extortion <ge>
<gb> after the public condemnation , the State General Attorney opened a criminal case against the mayor &apos;s brother and <ge> on September 2nd , he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days .
after four hours <gb> before the Agent of the Public Ministry for Heritage Crimes <ge> , he was transferred to the Temporary Jail <gb> , located in the Old Neighborhood of the state capital <ge> .
<gb> based on the record 197 / 2011 legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazabal and <ge> thereafter there may not be made any claim <gb> about the process <ge> that was intended against him <gb> ; also no damage repair or punishment will be required <ge> .
after the hearing of the legal representative <gb> of the bookmarkers <ge> , <gb> at almost 15 : 50 <ge> it was ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton .
the clerk <gb> of the court , Jorge Yanez , <ge> went to the jail of the municipality <gb> of San Nicolas of Garza <ge> to notify Jonah <gb> that he has been legally pardoned and his record will be filed <ge> .
the Secretary <gb> Dionisio Perez Jacome <ge> gives details of the crash where the Interior Minister <gb> , Francisco Blake , <ge> and seven others died .
<gb> &quot; the elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground , <ge> the blades came into contact with trees <gb> at 25 meters <ge> where the unit lost the fuselage . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> he also reported that <ge> the unit was designed for 19 people <gb> , so it fulfilled the necessary requirements to transport people <ge> .
<gb> he also said that <ge> the investigations <gb> made ​ ​ in the area of impact <ge> do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground .
<gb> &quot; <ge> in a research it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship in another place <gb> , the impact is presented in a structural way <ge> .
for now , <gb> the secretary said <ge> it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible <gb> ; however , the investigation may take several months or even one year <ge> .
&quot; this <gb> information <ge> reinforces the hypothesis of <gb> a <ge> normal cruise operation at <gb> the time of the <ge> impact , &quot; he said .
<gb> at the press conference , <ge> the owner <gb> of the SCT , Perez Jacome , <ge> listed six important elements in the investigation <gb> : <ge>
according to the aviation regulations the flight was conducted under visual flight rules <gb> , this means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground <ge> .
AICM reports were indicating suitable conditions for taking off <gb> as the aircraft moved towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State there were layers of clouds at low altitudes <ge> .
<gb> on the area of the accident <ge> there remains undisclosed evidence in the wreckage of the craft <gb> , some kind of explosion or fire <ge> .
<gb> the information provides elements that seem to indicate that <ge> the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground .
social Security directs a research to find the gene for obesity <gb> in children and young people ; it is supported by specialists from the IPN <ge>
once reached the goal <gb> of bringing 500 to 600 children <ge> , the study will continue in the Independence Sport Unit <gb> ( South the Mexico City ) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit ( North the Mexico City ) <ge> .
they will also be asked about physical activity <gb> and family hereditary history of disease , <ge> in order to avoid risk factors <gb> that give rise to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure <ge> .
<gb> he said <ge> the justification <gb> for searching the markers <ge> is based on that the population of the country differs from other <gb> in its genetic history <ge> .
he reported that <gb> on average , <ge> the Mexican has a 65 percent of American Indian heritage <gb> , 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight <ge> .
<gb> he explained that generally , <ge> the genetics of obesity result in the inability to burn off the excess energy <gb> that we consume ( calories ) and which is stored as fat <ge> .
the researcher explained that the direct benefit <gb> for the participants <ge> is a comprehensive assessment of the children <gb> , which can detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity <ge> .
<gb> even , he said , <ge> the presence of dark-colored folds <gb> ( acanthuses ) on the neck and forearm <ge> indicates the likelihood of suffering of metabolic disorders <gb> and even Prediabetes <ge> .
<gb> Rafael <ge> Herrera <gb> , a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM , <ge> develops <gb> polymer-modified <ge> asphalt to produce a mixture with the best performance <gb> , regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature <ge>
this means that the resistance <gb> of the street asphalt <ge> is not uniform , but is modified during the day <gb> according to the environmental conditions and temperature , said the specialist in chemical engineering <ge> .
among the most superficial layers is the asphalt <gb> , composed of small stones dipped into the asphalt and then compacted <ge> .
on the asphalt covering <gb> , he added , <ge> is placed a final layer <gb> called rolling covering , <ge> which is made of a fine stone material <gb> , meaning sand also dipped into the asphalt <ge> .
since this is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels <gb> of the vehicle <ge> , it must have a better mechanical strength <gb> than the asphalt covering and provide road friction <ge> .
when the ground is wet , <gb> water diffuses inside the covering and <ge> it &apos;s hard to get out <gb> , this causing a softening of all layers of the pavement and , therefore , the formation of potholes <ge> .
this time <gb> Melina Ramirez <ge> Serna had to be content with being on the winning podium <gb> , wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia <ge> .
a response that the jury did not like <gb> due to the term &quot; culturalization &apos; and second of all <ge> for not <gb> specifically <ge> explaining how each of the cited books have marked her .
<gb> but after the ceremony <ge> Melina said she was calm and happy with the result <gb> &quot; the universe is wise it happens what it has to happen <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
and that was noted in her first appearance <gb> in swimsuit on the beach of Hilton <ge> and during her two shows <gb> at the evening coronation <ge> .
<gb> another hypothesis is that <ge> Valley failed to convince the jury about her interest in social work <gb> , which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest <ge> .
<gb> this is why , <ge> two days before <gb> the election the international jury <ge> Lucy Doughty said they were seeking a woman committed to the social needs of her country .
<gb> &quot; <ge> beauty is not enough <gb> for a Miss Colombia <ge> , we must <gb> look beyond the physical appearance and <ge> focus on social awareness <gb> , before entering the contest they must be already involved in projects , &quot; she said <ge> .
<gb> meanwhile , <ge> the journalist Guido Hoyos <gb> , of Cromos magazine <ge> considers that the error of the Valley of Cauca were the surgical interventions she suffered .
<gb> however , <ge> she will go down in history as one of the queens that <gb> despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena , <ge> found difficulties in getting the crown .
in 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and <gb> , after making the corresponding courses , <ge> he specialized in lophoscopy <gb> , which is the study of skin friction , meaning the palms of the hands and feet <ge> .
the week of Eliazar &apos;s operation <gb> against alias Alfonso Cano <ge> he was warned to take clothes only for three days .
accompanied by a <gb> Galtonian <ge> magnifying glass , <gb> ink , a paddle and a flashlight , <ge> Eliazar compared the fingerprints <gb> of the corpse <ge> with those of the card .
the fingerprinting science <gb> is an exact science , without error , which <ge> can be key solution in solving crimes .
apart from the identification of bodies , the fingerprinting specialists support research for crimes <gb> like theft and murder and confirm the identity of those captured <ge> .
<gb> through the investigation it was determined that <ge> a relative could be suspected of the crime <gb> and , indeed , a print on the bottle matched <ge> .
<gb> although <ge> this does not guarantee that it was the murderer <gb> , it places him it in the murder scene <ge> .
<gb> a fingerprint expert of CTI explained that in objects &quot; <ge> footprints are drawn with chemical or physical reagents . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the councilman personally defended the evacuation <gb> of the Zuccotti square <ge> carried out at dawn <gb> , an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and this was decided so because protesters were &quot; violating the law <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
along with Michael Buble <gb> and other prominent Canadians , <ge> she will appear on the television program <gb> &quot; It &apos;s a Russell Peters Christmas &quot; on December 1st <ge>
in the scene , Peters <gb> , a well known Canadian comedian of Indian origin <ge> who recently appeared as a presenter <gb> on the tour of &quot; My Violent Torpedo of Truth &quot; by Charlie Sheen appears as Joseph <ge> .
GDP grows by 1.5 % due to domestic consumption <gb> and puts an end to the downward spiral that began in March <ge>
since last March , the Japanese economy was paralyzed <gb> , still recovering from the devastating earthquake , resulting in a nuclear crisis , the worst catastrophe suffered by the Nippon country since the Second World War <ge> .
the first estimates <gb> of Tokyo government <ge> regarding the material losses amounted to $ 300,000 million <gb> , a blow that , despite the difficult global context , seems to have dimmed <ge> .
the one recorded in the second quarter <gb> , for the Japanese the Fiscal Year begins in March 2012 - <ge> represents also the fastest rhythm of growth <gb> from January to March 2010 <ge> .
in fact , companies increased their investment by 1.1 % <gb> versus 0.9 % decline in capital expenditures which was observed from January to March , the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases <ge> .
Japan has awakened <gb> , especially <ge> thanks to the evolution of the household consumption <gb> , which now represents 60 % of the Japanese GDP <ge> .
with a stronger currency , the products are more expensive abroad <gb> , a serious slap for a country whose economic line is determined by the health of large technological groups <ge> .
as markets continue their siege <gb> of the peripheral countries of the EU <ge> , the Government <gb> of Yoshihiko Noda <ge> does not lower the guard .
<gb> the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development ( <ge> OECD <gb> ) <ge> said that most member countries showed <gb> in September <ge> clear signs of economic slowdown .
the euro zone <gb> even <ge> fell below the average <gb> , which is at the level of 100 , since it rushed eight tenths up to 99.13 points <ge> .
with peripheral risk subsidies launched <gb> and uncertainty reinstated in the parks <ge> , Greece is still entangled in the maze <gb> that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis <ge> .
<gb> a package of 24 programs to boost employment , <ge> reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives .
<gb> however , the message of Samaras does not clear the doubts about his position : &quot; <ge> we are committed to helping the transitional government , but we are not committed to anything . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the Microcredit Summit arises <gb> not only as a forum for debate , but also <ge> as a platform that promotes <gb> &quot; <ge> two basic goals . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> finally , <ge> the Queen Mrs. Sofia concluded by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and find solutions to advance the fight against poverty .
<gb> in this regard , <ge> she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries <gb> in times of economic boom , as it is a &quot; continuing obligation <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the motion on the preidency of the European Commission <gb> , tabled by the directorate , <ge> was adopted almost unanimously .
<gb> not only because Europe means peace , but because &quot; <ge> nine million jobs depend directly on the Euro . <gb> &quot; <ge>
this is <gb> , generally speaking , <ge> the case of one of the proposals of the motion <gb> adopted by the congress , whose inspiration clearly comes from Wolfgang Schäuble <ge> .
<gb> certainly , <ge> it is not probable that the Twenty-Seven will <gb> rapidly <ge> agree to this solution <gb> ; Great Britain is opposed to it and the heads of CDU think that Nicolas Sarkozy is also opposed to it <ge> .
first and foremost , <gb> with a view to budgetary economies , <ge> the government intends to impose <gb> on private employees <ge> a fourth day of unemployment <gb> before the start of unemployment benefit <ge>
clearly , <gb> without the specific consent of the employer , <ge> an employee falling sick will lose four days &apos; pay <gb> equal to at least 15 % of his / her monthly income <ge> .
a measure <gb> , which threatens to arouse anger , but which , according to Les Echos , <ge> would produce a saving of 280 million Euros .
<gb> now that these questions are being discussed , <ge> the majority are also relaunching the subject of fraud , targeting abuses linked to medical certificates .
<gb> according to the Caisse nationale d &apos;assurance maladie ( CNAM ) , <ge> over 237 million Euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006 .
<gb> comparing these figures with those of their European neighbours , <ge> French employees are no more inclined to take sick leave <gb> than those in any other country <ge> .
the strengthening of legislation <gb> since 2002 <ge> has led to systematic controls of certificates <gb> valid for longer than 45 days <ge> .
in 2008 , <gb> out of 1,5 million controls , <ge> the CNAM found that 13 % of the 285 000 controls <gb> on short-term sickness certificates <ge> were <gb> &quot; <ge> unjustified <gb> , &quot; or too long , &quot; equal to 37 050 cases <ge> .
in total therefore , 169 000 cases were <gb> &quot; <ge> unjustified <gb> , &quot; out of several million of employees issued with certificates <ge> .
a figure which represents very few cases <gb> , compared , for example , with the &quot; black &quot; labour figure <ge> .
on Monday , Antonis Samaras <gb> , the leader of the Right , <ge> gave his support to already approved measures <gb> to try and emerge from the debt crisis , but warned that his party would not support additional austerity <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we will not vote in favour of new measures <gb> , &quot; he said at a meeting with the deputies of his New Democracy party <ge> .
he declared his <gb> agreement with the objectives of reduction of the deficit and of the debt and of the struggle against waste , but also his <ge> opposition to any policy which would prevent economic recovery .
this committee recommends to <gb> the government to <ge> modify the criminal code <gb> , so as to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia when it is elected by a patient deemed competent to make such a decision <ge> .
<gb> at the outset , <ge> the experts cite a <gb> recent <ge> inquiry <gb> by the Economist Intelligence Unit , <ge> which compared the quality of death in 40 countries worldwide .
<gb> whilst Canada is placed 10th , <ge> the study notes that <gb> &quot; <ge> the medicalisation of death <gb> in Canada <ge> has produced a culture in which people are afraid to tackle the subject <gb> of death <ge> .
<gb> medicalisation or not , <ge> 77 % of Canadians do not have access to palliative care <gb> , report experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada <ge> .
countrywide , it is in Quebec that the rate is highest <gb> , with 86 % of deaths taking place in hospital <ge> .
on the contrary , <gb> affirmed during a teleconference , Jocelyn Downie , who submitted the report , <ge> more such cases were found precisely in those countries <gb> , where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalised <ge> .
<gb> regarding persons who commit assisted suicide , <ge> investigations indicate that 41 % of such cases should not have been prosecuted .
they also suggest <gb> among their other recommendations , <ge> that the penal code should state that <gb> legally valid <ge> withdrawal of nursing care is not criminal .
<gb> the committee of experts also requests that <ge> health professionals should be trained in the duty to respect a withdrawal of nursing care <gb> at the end of life without having to fear criminal prosecution <ge> .
regarding palliative care , the committee calls on governments <gb> , nursing institutions , and doctors <ge> to work together <gb> to provide the best possible palliative care and not only in cases of cancer <ge> .
certain experts in the field of the health-related legislation have already voiced reservations <gb> concerning the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada experts &apos; report <ge> .
the specialist in health legislation <gb> , Margaret Somerville also <ge> expressed &quot; strong opposition to the conclusions of the report , which she described as <gb> being <ge> &quot; obviously pro-euthanasia . &quot;
diplomatic pressures intensified yesterday on the Syria of Bachar al-Assad , who <gb> , with the support of Russia , <ge> is resisting them <gb> and has denounced a &quot; plot &quot; against his country <ge> .
<gb> in his turn , <ge> the <gb> Turkish <ge> foreign minister <gb> , Ahmet Davutoglu <ge> deplored the fact that <gb> Turkish <ge> efforts to mediate <gb> , which began at the start of the year , <ge> did not meet with success .
two other civilians died <gb> during exchanges of fire and heavy rifles at Jobar in the besieged town of Homs , according tot his ONG <ge> .
<gb> during a Press conference , <ge> the Syrian foreign minister Walid Mouallem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis . <gb> &quot; <ge>
he moreover reacted strongly against the decision <gb> of the Arab League <ge> to suspend Damascus <gb> which according to him represents a &quot; dangerous step <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the French foreign minister <gb> Alain Juppé also <ge> declared himself in favour to the dispatch of UNO observers <gb> to help to protect civilians from repression by the regime , which according to him , is &quot; paranoid <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the former European commissioner was yesterday in discussions with the political parties <gb> before today &apos;s meeting with unions and employers <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> Monti spoke about an important programme involving a lot of sacrifices <gb> , &quot; said Francesco Nucara , a deputy of one of the numerous small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting the prime minister-designate <ge> .
the consultations will end in the presentation <gb> by M. Monti <ge> of a limited list of a dozen or so ministers <gb> to the head of State , Giorgio Napolitano <ge> .
in a <gb> &quot; <ge> democracy , time is needed for the preparation of a <gb> government and a <ge> programme <gb> , he stressed , adding that he was certain that the markets would be patient and understanding <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
his appointment by the president was initially welcomed <gb> by the markets , but disquiet re-emerged , in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in Eurozone in September <ge> .
the prime minister-designate had to form a team <gb> , most importantly comprising technocrats , even though he stressed that he would also like to include &quot; politicians <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> according to the president of the Chamber of deputies , Gianfranco Fini , <ge> the new government would secure the vote of confidence of parliament <gb> by Friday <ge> .
<gb> m. Monti undertook that <ge> once in office he would work hard to ensure that Italy would <gb> once again <ge> become a protagonist <gb> in Europe <ge> .
<gb> a spokesman for the European Commissioner , <ge> Olli Rehn. stressed that &quot; regardless of a new government , our diagnostic of the Italian economy has not changed . <gb> &quot; <ge>
President Napolitano would like to avoid an early election , because <gb> by April 2012 <ge> Italy must place State debentures <gb> worth 200 thousand million Euros <ge> .
the Institute of Science of International Safety <gb> ISIS ) <ge> bases itself on the <gb> recent <ge> report from the International Atomic Safety Agency <gb> ( AIEA ) and other documents from this UNO agency , to identify this researcher <ge> .
<gb> last week , <ge> AIEA announced its serious disquiet concerning a &quot; possible military dimension <gb> &quot; of the Iranian nuclear programme <ge> .
the global number of hate crimes increased <gb> very slightly <ge> to 6 628 cases <gb> , of which 47,3 % were motivated by racial differences and 20 % by religious differences , according to FBI <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the American government can <gb> and must <ge> do more to deal with his abuse <gb> , he adds , judging that this could be due to the editing of police reports on hate crimes <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
this enables one to know if they <gb> cause messages to be monitored , if they subscribe new accounts , if they <ge> have favourite messages <gb> , etc <ge> .
this new Twitter formula was tested <gb> &quot; on a small percentage of users in August &quot; <ge> before being broadcast to the entire network <gb> on Monday , indicated a spokeswoman of Twitter , Carolyn Penner to AFP <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the functionality activity will help me to monitor better certain elements of my Twitter flow <gb> , &quot; sent @ dannykronstrom <ge> .
the dispositions adopted by the Austrian government approach the &quot; German model , &quot; <gb> being the first European country to adopt this &quot; rule . &quot; <ge>
the objective is that of making public debt fall below the 60 % <gb> criterion fixed by the treaty of Maastricht by 2020 / 2021 <ge> .
the <gb> Japanese <ge> prime minister <gb> , Yoshihiko Noda , <ge> warned <gb> on Tuesday <ge> that the <gb> Japanese <ge> authorities would <gb> again <ge> intervene in the exchanges market <gb> if the value of the yen continued to rise <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we would intervene as we did the last time <gb> , if we found excessive volatility in the rate of exchange of the yen , explained M. Noda to the Senate <ge> .
<gb> on Tuesday , <ge> the yen rose to near historical levels <gb> , causing the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October <ge> .
on that date , Tokyo sold the yen against the dollar <gb> on a massive scale <ge> in order to cut the value of the Japanese currency <gb> , which was setting a new record of strength since 1945 <ge> .
on Tuesday , the dollar fell below 77 yen and the Euro fell under <gb> the symbolic bar of <ge> 105 yen <gb> , close to levels which triggered the last intervention <ge> .
<gb> prior to the financial crisis of 2008-2009 , <ge> the dollar was about 120 yen and the Euro over 160 yen .
this rise of the <gb> Japanese <ge> currency damages <gb> Japanese <ge> exports , because it <gb> makes Japanese products more expensive and <ge> reduces the value of income of Japanese firms <gb> from abroad , when converted into the national currency <ge> .
<gb> but the prime minister felt that <ge> the high price of the yen did to reflect &quot; Japan &apos;s economic fundamentals . &quot;
but the deputy governor <gb> of the institution , Hirohide Yamaguchi , <ge> warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken steps <gb> the &quot; appropriate steps &quot; stating that no additional monetary flexibility was to be expected on Wednesday <ge>
despite the appointment of new heads of government <gb> in Greece and in Italy and better growth figures in France and in Germany <ge> , the rates in fragile countries continue to rise .
<gb> still worried about the stability of Eurozone , <ge> European exchanges have entered a little further <gb> into the negative area on this Tuesday 15 November <ge> .
the Tokyo exchange closed with a fall of 0,7 % <gb> , suffering fresh doubts of market participants on the subject of the capacity of Europe to contain the debt crisis <ge> .
this re-emergence of disquiet <gb> about the future of Eurozone <ge> penalises the single currency <gb> , which has continued to fall on Tuesday <ge> .
these tensions of the rates of interest of southern countries <gb> , but also France , continue to feed the apprehensions of participants <ge> .
<gb> the head of the future Italian government , Mario <ge> Monti asked the markets for time to restore the situation <gb> in an Italy threatened by asphyxia by the weight of its debt <ge> .
the <gb> new Greek <ge> prime minister <gb> Lucas Papademos <ge> affirmed that the implementation of decisions <gb> taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October <ge> would be <gb> &quot; <ge> the principal task <gb> &quot; of his government <ge> .
<gb> the spread of the rate between 10-year German and Spanish bonds has reached a new historically high level . <ge>
France has recorded an economic growth of 0,4 % in the third quarter <gb> , a little better than the expected 0,3 % , due to increased household consumption <ge> .
the Inseen nevertheless revised downwards <gb> the figure for the second quarter , <ge> with a fall of 0,1 % of the gross internal product <gb> ( PIB ) instead of stagnation <ge> .
a first estimate <gb> in respect of the whole Eurozone <ge> is expected at 11 a.m <gb> , the European Commission having warned against the risk of a new recession . <ge>
this is not the case of Belgium <gb> , which subordinates its decision to the need to find a source able to replace nuclear energy , <ge> or that of Switzerland <gb> , which intends to build only the most modern ones <ge> .
the United States <gb> , <ge> decided <gb> after Fukushima <ge> to add a unit to their range by resuming the construction of a centre <gb> , which was interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident <ge> .
<gb> although <ge> the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes quoted as an example <gb> , the reality contradicts that argument <ge> .
<gb> on the other hand , thanks to the constancy of energy policy , <ge> our neighbours pay 40 % more for their electricity than French households .
since <gb> in the worldwide economy <ge> the cost of energy is a key factor <gb> of competitiveness and a stake in the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory <ge> , <gb> French <ge> companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe .
it should be recalled that the energy policy <gb> of our country <ge> made it possible to establish <gb> an industrial line of <ge> 125 000 direct jobs <gb> and 410 000 resulting ones <ge> .
<gb> strongly export-oriented , <ge> it attracts a galaxy of specialised RME &apos;s in international markets and creates many jobs <gb> , which cannot be moved elsewhere <ge> .
if France decided to abandon nuclear power , she would <gb> sacrifice a large number of these RME &apos;s and <ge> lose the annual <gb> 6 thousand <ge> million Euro &apos;s worth of <gb> French <ge> exports <gb> of nuclear equipment and services <ge> .
<gb> to solve the energy equation , <ge> it must be admitted that there is no miraculous or diabolical source of production of electricity .
at Fukushima , some people appear to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters <gb> of unprecedented magnitude , which caused the death of tens of thousands of people <ge> .
in 2005 , the fear of invasion <gb> of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers <ge> was felt both on the Left and on the Right .
in his programme , François Hollande confines himself to banalities <gb> , saying that co-development would allow our immigration problem to be solved <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
this notion of immigration <gb> being a burden and a problem , <ge> may be an electoral asset <gb> , but it is economically very costly <ge> .
fears <gb> about the impact of immigrants <ge> are based on the notion that they are liable to replace native workers <gb> , in particular unskilled ones , exerting downward pressure on wages <ge> .
<gb> but <ge> experience shows that in reality immigrants are <gb> much <ge> more complementary to <gb> , rather than replacements of , local labour , exercising trades in which there is a shortage of <ge> local labour .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors , which do not attract local labour <gb> and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment <ge> .
migrants are also net contributors to social systems <gb> , averaging 1 % of the total budgets of European countries <ge> .
Nicolas Sarkozy wished at the start of his mandate to look for missing points of growth <gb> &quot; with the teeth <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
some believed that it was enough for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies <gb> , to exercise the vote , and to do so as directly as possible <ge> .
<gb> the European crisis , which we are passing through , is an economic crisis , but <ge> it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy .
the truth is that the lines of the forefront <gb> of democratic struggle <ge> have now moved <gb> , and that for many , the republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction <ge> .
we have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums <gb> organised as required and in a confused sequence <ge> .
the &quot; free hand &quot; <gb> of an absolute European monarch , <ge> or a jump with tied feet into the nationalist void <gb> ; what a choice for a citizen <ge> !
<gb> no , <ge> we do not want the blades of a guillotine , but an exercise <gb> , joint , serene and ongoing , of choice and <ge> of democracy <gb> , this time on European level <ge> .
there are no crises in Greece <gb> , Italy , Spain or Portugal and one would not know where to stop enumerating them , <ge> because there is only a single crisis <gb> and that is in Europe <ge> .
it is the whole of Europe , which defers to the dictates of <gb> the markets and of <ge> rating agencies <gb> , who suffer from their incapacity and a lack of solidarity <ge> .
because it is by all working together , that Europeans will be able <gb> reduce the weight of their individual debts , <ge> to free themselves from the markets <gb> and to prepare for the future by investing in it <ge> .
emerging from the crisis will entail decisions on European level <gb> , which cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy without leading us into disaster <ge> .
<gb> after having long fought this proposal by specialists and of Jacques Delors , <ge> the whole world now calls for a European economic government .
<gb> but <ge> the idea <gb> without stronger economic , political and democratic integration and lived in such by citizens , <ge> would be a fresh folly and a new impasse .
the year 2011 should <gb> actually <ge> end on an 11 % rise of worldwide sales <gb> of microprocessors ( Bank cards , telephones with a SIM card ... ) , with over 6 thousand million units <ge> , according to Eurosmart .
the most important sector is that of contactless technology <gb> , which enables paying for common transport or paying for purchases simply by passing the card over a reader <ge> .
their share will progress in 2012 <gb> ( 580 million units expected ) and represent almost 10 % of the global market of chip cards ( 6,925 million cards ) <ge> .
for a long time , <gb> lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region , <ge> Europe is now gaining ground in contactless payment .
<gb> some <ge> 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality <gb> and 75 000 payment terminals accept them <ge> .
<gb> but <ge> this is only a first stage of the future mode of payment <gb> , namely , the mobile telephone <ge> .
few apparatus are at present equipped with NFC technology <gb> ( Near Field Communication , essential for implementing these transactions <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we are counting on a worldwide sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 <gb> , explains Marc Bertin , president of Eurosmart <ge> .
<gb> and the <ge> Société Générale also said <gb> yesterday <ge> that it is preparing the <gb> market <ge> launch of an offer <gb> enabling its clients to pay via their mobiles <ge> .
<gb> suspected for a long time , <ge> the links between <gb> the terrorist group <ge> al-Qaida <gb> in the Islamic Maghreb ( Aqmi ) <ge> and the <gb> Nigerian <ge> Boko Haram sect have been confirmed .
on Sunday , the <gb> Algerian <ge> deputy foreign minister <gb> , Abdelkader Messahel , even <ge> stated that Algiers is now certain .
<gb> among the rubble left behind by the action , French and Nigerian <ge> investigators found several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists .
<gb> &quot; this is an advance , but <ge> it is <gb> undoubtedly <ge> necessary to await more exact proofs before talking <gb> about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> &quot; <ge> it has been known for years that the sect benefits from outside financial <gb> and intellectual <ge> support <gb> and that it is becoming more and more active , says Kunle Amuwo , a Nigerian researcher <ge> .
it <gb> is politicised and <ge> demands rigid respect of sharia <gb> , whilst its militants engage in a struggle with the impious central government <ge> .
<gb> concerning China , Iran , aid to Israel , Mitt Romney , Herman Cain , and <ge> Rick Perry compete in simplification and a lack of knowledge .
can an America weakened by crisis <gb> , <ge> lead a complex world <gb> by simple and indeed , simplistic , ideas <ge> ?
for some days , <gb> Mitt Romney , Herman Cain , Rick Perry and <ge> the others multiply resounding and abbreviated foreign policy declarations <gb> , which are traditionally a republican strong suit <ge> .
Jon Huntsman <gb> , Obama &apos;s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a vision of a sophisticated foreign policy , <ge> has failed to suppress an attitude which flatters the emotions .
HR also promised to increase military aid to Israel <gb> , accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to wards that partner <ge> .
the entrepreneur <gb> Herman Cain , the second best-placed candidate , <ge> declares an embarrassing lack of knowledge <gb> of the files <ge> .
recently , he called for opposition to the Chinese military threat <gb> , because Peking is trying to develop a nuclear capacity - apparently unaware of the fact that China has possessed it since 1964 <ge> !
the <gb> Texas <ge> governor <gb> Rick Perry , who supports Israel and wants military strikes against Iran , <ge> says that he is ready to involve the USA army in Mexico <gb> against the drug cartels <ge> .
resort to the torture of terrorist suspects prohibited by Obama in 2009 <gb> , is also recommended by Cain , Perry and by the candidate Michele Bachmann <ge> .
<gb> they recall that <ge> Obama <gb> himself was an amateur and that he <ge> had to water down his wine concerning anti-terrorism .
they insist <gb> with good reason <ge> on the setback of his naive dialogue with Iran on the premature departure <gb> of the &quot; boys &quot; <ge> from Iraq <gb> , his tergiversations in Libya labelling him weak <ge> .
<gb> and in arguing that <ge> it is necessary to reconstruct America economically to revive its leadership <gb> , Obama is right <ge> .
the North Stream gasduct <gb> connecting Western Europe and Russia directly along the bottom of the Baltic sea , <ge> has been commissioned .
a second pipeline is due to be ready by the end of 2012 <gb> , making it possible to deliver a total of 55 thousand million cubic metres of gas , the equivalent of the entire French consumption <ge> .
<gb> the <ge> North Stream will in fact allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany <gb> , avoiding any passage via a third country ( Poland or the Ukraine ) <ge> .
<gb> these two countries will lose some of their power : <ge> it will become more difficult for them to influence Russia <gb> by threatening to close access to West European markets <ge> .
at the most critical point of the debate , Warsaw did not hesitate to compare <gb> North Stream <ge> new <gb> &quot; <ge> German-Soviet pact <gb> , &quot; referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939 <ge> .
<gb> but at the price of depriving Europe of energy , <ge> since the project has created a breach between eastern and western Europe .
Russia has succeeded in <gb> less than five years , in <ge> achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the <gb> the rich <ge> Western countries <gb> , which consume large quantities of gas , and whose deposits are declining <ge> .
the undersea pipeline is made of steel embedded in concrete <gb> , in order to protect it from ships &apos; anchors <ge> .
&quot; a hundred had to be removed or destroyed <gb> as a precaution <ge> , &quot; says Jens Müller <gb> , spokesman of North Stream company <ge> .
the pipeline is a long metal serpent <gb> , of weight equivalent to that of 242 Eiffel towers , <ge> with no breaks throughout its length <gb> , no valves and no maintenance stations <ge> .
a control platform was provided <gb> on the level of Sweden , <ge> but the project managers abandoned it <gb> since the Swedes were not keen on seeing a Russian State company becoming permanently on its shores <ge> .
<gb> &quot; in case of accident <ge> we stop the passage of gas <gb> for at least one minute , &quot; states Jens Müller <ge> .
but this is thought to be unlikely by the constructors <gb> who provided welds to leak only every 100 000 years <ge> .
<gb> being cigar-shaped , <ge> it is introduced inside the 1-metre wide pipeline <gb> , and it is pushed along by the gas <ge> .
these five companies have created a joint enterprise <gb> called North Stream <ge> , delegated to <gb> construct and to <ge> operate the gasduct .
<gb> &quot; <ge> Gazprom will pay for the total capacity , whatever may be the quantity of gas actually transported <gb> , &quot; states Jens Müller <ge> .
it is a scent of adventure <gb> , of hours sent in writing by a the light of a candle <ge> .
the Moleskine notebook is easily recognised <gb> , by its black rectangular cover , its elastic , its broken white pages , as if aged over time <ge> .
Maria Sebregondi <gb> , then a consultant of the company , <ge> has assumed responsibility for the launch of the new product .
the notebook draws its inspiration from an old production technique , <gb> the mole skin which means varnished cotton used for covering benches , <ge> for example .
it is difficult to establish a profile of the <gb> typical <ge> purchaser , because the notebook attracts <gb> equally <ge> a businessman , a student and a professional .
the small Italian company <gb> , which had only 12 employees at the start , <ge> now has almost 100 and two offices <gb> , one in Milan and the other in New York <ge> .
its distributes its notebooks to Fnac libraries <gb> , small shops in town centres <ge> and has succeeded in becoming well known .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we followed the spirit of the times <gb> and this need for new means of writing <ge> , notwithstanding the rise of e-mail <gb> , &quot; explains Maria Sebregondi <ge> .
this cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine <gb> ; recently , the brand launched an exhibition &quot; Detour &quot; where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook <ge> .
<gb> in August , <ge> it also launched a <gb> leopardskin pattern <ge> cover on the occasion of the Film Festival <gb> in Locarno <ge> .
<gb> exploiting its success and the cultural aura , <ge> Moleskine diversified its products to include <gb> handbags , pens , <ge> computer bags . <gb> the brand includes every kind of support . <ge>
<gb> a success , which aroused envy ; in the autumn of 2006 , <ge> Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe <gb> , now Syntegra Capital , to write a new page in the history of Moleskine <ge> .
despite a public voluntary policy <gb> introduced in 2005 <ge> , the rate of unemployment <gb> of the handicapped <ge> is still twice as high as the average <gb> , namely 19 % , versus 9 % for the population as a whole <ge> .
<gb> &quot; no , stresses Eric Blanchet , Director-General of Adapt , <ge> the association which organises the week for the employment of the handicapped . <gb> &quot; <ge>
<gb> they have rather a low level of qualifications ; <ge> 80 % do not have the &quot; bac &quot; and out of the 2.3 million students <gb> in higher education <ge> only 10 000 are handicapped .
<gb> lastly , <ge> long-term unemployment is very widespread <gb> , being 85 % for the handicapped versus 38 % on an average <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> we are now on around 3 % <gb> , &quot; says Pierre Blanc , director-general of the Agefiph , the organisation responsible for collecting contributions from companies which do not observe this law <ge> .
<gb> proof : <ge> the number of <gb> &quot; <ge> taxed <gb> &quot; <ge> establishments <gb> , like the sums paid , <ge> have fallen between 2007 and 2011 <gb> , from 59 000 to 46 000 structures ( and from 606 to 480 million Euros ) <ge> .
<gb> &quot; <ge> the law of 2005 , <gb> which raised the contributions , <ge> created a strong pressure on companies <gb> , explains Pierre Blanc <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
according to the ministry of employment , only 59 % of establishments <gb> employing between 20 and 49 handicapped persons , <ge> versus 82 % of companies <gb> employing between 100 and 199 persons <ge> .
we do not go so far as to say that there was connivance between them <gb> , but the image is symbolic <ge> .
<gb> &quot; at Lille , <ge> I am there all the year round <gb> , which is not the case of Belgium <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
the Portugal of Paulo Bento starts its return match against Bosnia ( <gb> 22h00 ) very optimistically , this Tuesday in Lisbon . <ge>
<gb> &quot; at the end of these 90 minutes , <ge> we will be a happy team <gb> and most importantly , a happy country <ge> . <gb> &quot; <ge>
in view of the ( 0-0 ) <gb> , on Friday in the hell of Zenica <ge> it is clear that the games are not over .
<gb> whilst Portugal dominated the match for over one hour , <ge> it was not able to reach this precious target <gb> , which would have consoled it <ge> .
<gb> &quot; we are expecting a very close match , but <ge> we are convinced that we can win <gb> , declared the Portuguese trainer aged 42 <ge> .
&quot; we are going to play a team which has many technical qualities and which has players possessing many individual qualities , <gb> &quot; he added <ge> .
<gb> as already in Zenica , <ge> the Portuguese would <gb> plan to <ge> exert maximal pressure on the Bosnians <gb> from the start , <ge> to &quot; give them no time to think . &quot;
